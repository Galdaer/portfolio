# Intelluxe AI Healthcare System - Immediate Implementation TODO

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-06  
**Priority**: HIPAA/Privacy-First Development - Immediate Tasks Only

## PRIORITY 1: Enhanced PHI Detection & Testing

### 1.1 Upgrade Synthetic Data to PHI-Like Content
**Priority**: IMMEDIATE - Security Foundation  
**Risk**: Current synthetic data doesn't properly test PHI detection systems  
**Requires**: Healthcare domain expertise for realistic PHI patterns

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Update synthetic email generation** in `scripts/generate_synthetic_healthcare_data.py`
  - Generate emails that look like PHI but are synthetic (realistic names, addresses, phone numbers)
  - Include synthetic SSNs, medical record numbers, and insurance IDs that match real patterns
  - Add realistic medical terminology and conditions in emails
  - Ensure synthetic data would trigger PHI detectors if they were real

- [ ] **Enhance synthetic patient data** to include PHI-like patterns:
  - Realistic medical record numbers following healthcare system patterns
  - Synthetic but realistic insurance member IDs
  - Phone numbers following NANP standards with realistic area codes
  - Addresses that look real but are synthetic
  - Names that could appear in real healthcare settings

- [ ] **Validate PHI detection effectiveness**:
  - Run PHI detectors against new synthetic data
  - Ensure detectors properly flag synthetic-but-realistic PHI patterns
  - Update PHI detection rules if gaps are found
  - Document PHI detection capabilities and limitations

**Privacy Considerations**:
- All data remains synthetic but tests real-world PHI detection scenarios
- Enhances security by ensuring PHI detectors work against realistic patterns
- Exceeds HIPAA minimum by testing more robust PHI detection

## PRIORITY 2: Advanced Insurance & Cost Prediction

### 2.1 Enhanced Insurance Coverage Modeling
**Priority**: HIGH - Business Value & New Features  
**Benefit**: Accurate cost predictions improve patient experience  
**Requires**: Healthcare billing domain expertise for complex insurance scenarios

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **Expand insurance types support**:
  - Percentage-based copays (e.g., 20% coinsurance)
  - Multiple copay types (office visit, specialist, emergency)
  - Deductible tracking and remaining balance calculation
  - Out-of-pocket maximum tracking
  - HSA/FSA account integration

- [ ] **Deductible proximity tracking**:
  - Calculate remaining deductible amount
  - Project when patient will meet deductible
  - Show percentage toward deductible completion
  - Historical spending analysis for deductible planning

- [ ] **Visit cost prediction engine**:
  - CPT code to cost mapping by insurance plan
  - Real-time cost calculation based on patient's specific coverage
  - Pre-visit cost estimates with confidence intervals
  - Integration with scheduling system for cost transparency

- [ ] **Enhanced billing helper agent capabilities**:
  - Update `agents/billing_helper/` with advanced insurance logic
  - Implement cost prediction algorithms
  - Add insurance plan analysis tools
  - Create patient cost communication tools

**Privacy Implementation**:
- All insurance calculations done locally
- No external insurance verification APIs unless explicitly configured
- Audit logging for all cost calculations
- Patient consent tracking for cost prediction services

## âœ… DELEGATED TO CODING AGENT ALIGNMENT

The following priorities are handled by systematic code alignment using `CODING_AGENT_ALIGNMENT_PROMPT.md`:

### **Database-First Architecture** â†’ **Coding Agent Alignment**
- Remove all synthetic file fallbacks
- Add database connectivity requirements to all agents
- Update error handling and validation patterns
- Systematic refactoring of existing codebase

### **MCP Offline Capabilities** â†’ **Covered in FUTURE_TODO.md**
- Local website mirroring infrastructure  
- MCP server architecture updates
- Client data preparation systems
- Comprehensive implementation planned post-alignment

---

## ðŸ“‹ COMPREHENSIVE ROADMAP REFERENCES

### **For Systematic Code Alignment**:
- **`CODING_AGENT_ALIGNMENT_PROMPT.md`** - Complete codebase alignment for database-first, offline-capable, privacy-first architecture

### **For Future Feature Development**:
- **`FUTURE_TODO.md`** - Comprehensive roadmap with PHASE 1-3 implementation plan covering all advanced features, enterprise capabilities, and production deployment

### **For Development Guidance**:
- **`.github/instructions/`** - 60+ specialized instruction files covering all development patterns, compliance requirements, and technical standards

---

## Implementation Order

1. **Complete Priority 1** (Enhanced PHI Detection) - Security foundation
2. **Complete Priority 2** (Advanced Insurance) - New business features  
3. **Run Coding Agent Alignment** - Systematic codebase compliance alignment
4. **Begin FUTURE_TODO.md implementation** - Advanced features and enterprise capabilities

**Next Steps**: Focus on the 2 immediate priorities above, then use the alignment and roadmap documents for systematic development.
