3. Compliance monitor service
4. Business intelligence service

### **Phase 2: Advanced Services (Weeks 5-8)**
1. Doctor personalization service
2. Real-time medical assistant service
3. Patient assignment service
4. Continuous learning service

### **Phase 3: Enhancements (Weeks 9-10)**
1. Enhanced monitoring dashboards
2. Enhanced API documentation
3. Performance optimizations

## Notes

### **Current System Strengths**
- **Strong AI Infrastructure**: Chain-of-thought, Tree of Thoughts, multi-agent orchestration already implemented
- **Comprehensive Medical Data**: PubMed, Clinical Trials, FDA integration complete
- **Solid Security Framework**: PHI detection, RBAC, healthcare security in place
- **Agent Framework**: All core healthcare agents implemented within healthcare-api
- **Production Monitoring**: Grafana dashboards and logging infrastructure exist

### **Main Gap: Business Service Architecture**
The primary missing piece is extracting business logic from the healthcare-api agents into standalone microservices as envisioned in the phase plans. Current billing, insurance, and other business logic exists within agents but needs to be refactored into independent services.

### **Local LLM Focus Maintained**
All recommendations maintain the local LLM architecture - no cloud dependencies or multi-tenant features that would compromise the on-premise, privacy-first design.
