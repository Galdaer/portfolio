# Phase 0 Enhanced Development Infrastructure Implementation

## Context
You are implementing the remaining Phase 0 enhanced development infrastructure for Intelluxe AI healthcare system. The basic foundation is complete - focus ONLY on the unchecked items from the Phase 0 checklist.

## Architecture Constraints
- **Service Deployment**: Use ONLY the universal-service-runner.sh pattern for all services
- **Configuration Format**: All services must use .conf files in services/user/SERVICE/ directories
- **Bootstrap Integration**: Services must integrate with the existing bootstrap.sh workflow
- **No Docker Compose**: The system uses individual container management, not docker-compose

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. DeepEval Healthcare Testing Framework (Priority: High)
**Files to create:**
- `tests/healthcare_evaluation/deepeval_config.py`
- `tests/healthcare_evaluation/synthetic_data_generator.py`
- `tests/healthcare_evaluation/multi_agent_tests.py`
- `data/evaluation/synthetic/` directory structure
- `config/testing/healthcare_metrics.yml`

**Requirements:**
- Integrate with existing PostgreSQL/Redis infrastructure
- Use Ollama models (llama3.1, mistral) for evaluation
- HIPAA-compliant synthetic patient data generation
- Multi-agent conversation testing framework
- 30+ healthcare-specific evaluation metrics

### 2. Healthcare MCP Server (Priority: High)
**Files to create:**
- `services/user/healthcare-mcp/healthcare-mcp.conf` (using universal service runner format)
- `src/healthcare_mcp/secure_mcp_server.py`
- `src/healthcare_mcp/phi_detection.py`
- `src/healthcare_mcp/audit_logger.py`
- `docker/mcp-server/Dockerfile.healthcare`

**Requirements:**
- FastMCP-based server with security hardening
- PHI detection and masking middleware
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Read-only container filesystem
- Integration with existing bootstrap.sh service management

### 3. VS Code AI Development Environment (Priority: Medium)
**Files to create:**
- `.vscode/settings.json` (healthcare-specific AI assistance)
- `src/development/ai_assistant_config.py`
- `src/development/healthcare_code_patterns.py`
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (PHI detection hooks)

**Requirements:**
- Claude Sonnet 4 integration with healthcare compliance
- Medical terminology validation
- PHI detection during development
- HIPAA-compliant code generation patterns

### 4. Enhanced CI/CD Pipeline (Priority: Medium)
**Files to create:**
- `.github/workflows/healthcare_evaluation.yml`
- `.github/workflows/security_validation.yml`
- `scripts/validate-dev-environment.sh`

**Requirements:**
- Automated healthcare AI testing
- Security compliance validation
- Integration with existing testing infrastructure

### 5. Production Security Foundation (Priority: High)
**Files to create:**
- `src/security/healthcare_security.py`
- `src/security/encryption_manager.py`
- `src/security/rbac_foundation.py`
- `config/security/hipaa_compliance.yml`

**Requirements:**
- Healthcare-specific security middleware
- Audit logging for compliance
- Role-based access control foundation
- Encryption frameworks for patient data

## Technical Specifications

### Service Configuration Format
Use this exact format for healthcare-mcp service:
```bash
# services/user/healthcare-mcp/healthcare-mcp.conf
image="intelluxe/healthcare-mcp:latest"
port="8000:8000"
description="Secure healthcare MCP server with audit logging and PHI protection"
env="MCP_SECURITY_MODE=healthcare,PHI_DETECTION_ENABLED=true"
volumes="./logs:/app/logs:rw,./data/mcp:/app/data:ro"
network_mode="intelluxe-net"
restart_policy="unless-stopped"
healthcheck="curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1"
depends_on="postgres,redis"
```

### Integration Points
- **Database**: Use existing PostgreSQL connection (localhost:5432, database: intelluxe)
- **Cache**: Use existing Redis (localhost:6379)
- **Models**: Integrate with Ollama service (localhost:11434)
- **Logging**: Use existing logging infrastructure in logs/ directory
- **Bootstrap**: Services must be startable via `./scripts/universal-service-runner.sh start SERVICE`

### Environment Variables
Add these to .env.example:
```bash
# Healthcare AI Security
MCP_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_fernet_key_here
PHI_DETECTION_ENABLED=true
AUDIT_LOGGING_LEVEL=comprehensive
HIPAA_COMPLIANCE_MODE=strict

# Development Acceleration
AI_ASSISTANT_ENABLED=true
MEDICAL_TERMINOLOGY_CHECK=true
DEEPEVAL_ENABLED=true
```

## Validation Criteria
- All services deployable via universal-service-runner.sh
- Healthcare testing framework operational with synthetic data
- PHI detection working in development environment
- Security middleware protecting all healthcare endpoints
- CI/CD pipeline executing healthcare evaluations
- Development environment validation script passes all checks

## Deliverables
1. All missing files implemented according to Phase 0 specifications
2. Services integrated with existing bootstrap.sh workflow
3. Comprehensive testing framework operational
4. Security foundations validated
5. Development acceleration tools verified
6. Updated requirements.txt with new dependencies

Focus on healthcare compliance, security, and development acceleration while maintaining compatibility with the existing universal service runner architecture.
