### Business Logic Analysis Process

1. **Agent Inventory**:
   - Scan `services/user/healthcare-api/agents/` directory
   - Identify agents with standalone business logic
   - Map agent dependencies and data flows

2. **Extraction Candidates**:
   - Billing and insurance processing logic
   - Compliance monitoring and auditing
   - Analytics and reporting functions
   - Document processing workflows
   - Personalization and preference management

3. **Service Design**:
   - Define clear service boundaries
   - Design RESTful APIs between services
   - Plan data sharing and synchronization
   - Ensure HIPAA compliance throughout

4. **Implementation Pattern**:
   - Extract core business logic into dedicated service
   - Implement Chain-of-Thought or Tree of Thoughts reasoning
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Create service-specific configuration and deployment

### Reasoning Pattern Integration

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Linear Decisions:**
```python
class ChainOfThoughtProcessor:
    """Implement step-by-step reasoning for linear decision processes"""
    
    async def process_with_reasoning(self, request: dict) -> dict:
        reasoning_steps = []
        
        # Step 1: Initial assessment
        step1 = await self.initial_assessment(request)
        reasoning_steps.append({
            "step": 1,
            "action": "Initial Assessment", 
            "reasoning": step1["reasoning"],
            "result": step1["result"]
        })
        
        # Step 2: Data validation
        step2 = await self.validate_data(request, step1["result"])
        reasoning_steps.append({
            "step": 2,
            "action": "Data Validation",
            "reasoning": step2["reasoning"], 
            "result": step2["result"]
        })
        
        # Step 3: Business logic application
        step3 = await self.apply_business_logic(request, step2["result"])
        reasoning_steps.append({
            "step": 3,
            "action": "Business Logic",
            "reasoning": step3["reasoning"],
            "result": step3["result"]
        })
        
        return {
            "final_result": step3["result"],
            "reasoning_chain": reasoning_steps,
            "confidence": self.calculate_confidence(reasoning_steps)
        }
```

**Tree of Thoughts (ToT) for Complex Decisions:**
```python
class TreeOfThoughtsProcessor:
    """Implement parallel reasoning paths for complex decision processes"""
    
    async def process_with_reasoning(self, request: dict) -> dict:
        # Generate multiple reasoning paths
        reasoning_paths = await asyncio.gather(
            self.path_conservative(request),
            self.path_aggressive(request), 
            self.path_balanced(request)
        )
        
        # Evaluate each path
        evaluated_paths = []
        for i, path in enumerate(reasoning_paths):
            evaluation = await self.evaluate_path(path, request)
            evaluated_paths.append({
                "path_id": i,
                "approach": path["approach"],
                "reasoning": path["steps"],
                "score": evaluation["score"],
                "confidence": evaluation["confidence"],
                "result": path["result"]
            })
        
        # Select best path
        best_path = max(evaluated_paths, key=lambda x: x["score"])
        
        return {
            "final_result": best_path["result"],
            "selected_path": best_path,
            "alternative_paths": [p for p in evaluated_paths if p != best_path],
            "reasoning_summary": best_path["reasoning"]
        }
```

### HIPAA Compliance Integration

All extracted services must include:

1. **PHI Detection**: Use existing `core.infrastructure.phi_monitor`
2. **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trails for all operations
3. **Access Control**: Integration with RBAC systems
4. **Data Encryption**: Encrypted data at rest and in transit
5. **Compliance Reporting**: Regular compliance status reports

### Testing Requirements

Create comprehensive test suites including:

1. **Unit Tests**: Core business logic functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Service-to-service communication  
3. **Compliance Tests**: HIPAA compliance validation
4. **Performance Tests**: Load testing and benchmarking
5. **Security Tests**: PHI handling and access control

### Service Integration Patterns

**Service Discovery Pattern:**
```python
async def discover_services(self) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """Discover other services via health checks"""
    services = {
        "healthcare-api": "http://172.20.0.21:8000",
        "insurance-verification": "http://172.20.0.23:8000",
        "billing-engine": "http://172.20.0.24:8000",
        "compliance-monitor": "http://172.20.0.25:8000"
    }
    
    available_services = {}
    for name, url in services.items():
        if await self.check_service_health(url):
            available_services[name] = url
    
    return available_services
```

**Inter-Service Communication:**
```python
async def call_service(self, service_name: str, endpoint: str, data: dict) -> dict:
    """Standard inter-service communication with retry logic"""
    service_url = await self.get_service_url(service_name)
    
    for attempt in range(3):  # Retry up to 3 times
        try:
            async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
                response = await client.post(
                    f"{service_url}/{endpoint}",
                    json=data,
                    timeout=30.0
                )
                
                if response.status_code == 200:
                    return response.json()
                else:
                    raise HTTPException(
                        status_code=response.status_code,
                        detail=response.text
                    )
                    
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == 2:  # Last attempt
                raise
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
```
