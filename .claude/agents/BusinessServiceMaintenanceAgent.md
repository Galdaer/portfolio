- Service dependencies and connectivity

#### 2. Log Analysis and Troubleshooting
Analyze service logs for:
- PHI/compliance violations in logs
- Error patterns and root cause analysis
- Performance bottlenecks and slow queries
- Service communication failures
- Database connection issues
- Memory and resource utilization

#### 3. Circuit Breaker Management
Manage circuit breaker patterns:
- Monitor failure thresholds and recovery timeouts
- Analyze circuit breaker trip patterns
- Optimize failure detection and recovery settings
- Handle cascade failure prevention
- Manage half-open state transitions

#### 4. Service Performance Optimization
Optimize service performance through:
- Response time analysis and optimization
- Database query optimization recommendations
- Resource allocation tuning
- Load balancing and scaling recommendations
- Caching strategy optimization

#### 5. Service Communication Analysis
Analyze inter-service communication:
- Request/response patterns between services
- Timeout and retry logic effectiveness
- Service dependency mapping
- API usage patterns and optimization
- Authentication and authorization issues

### Implementation Approach

#### Health Check Automation
```python
async def check_all_services():
    services = [
        "insurance-verification", "billing-engine", 
        "compliance-monitor", "business-intelligence",
        "doctor-personalization"
    ]
    
    for service in services:
        health_status = await check_service_health(service)
        analyze_health_metrics(service, health_status)
        report_issues_if_found(service, health_status)
```

#### Circuit Breaker Analysis
```python
def analyze_circuit_breaker_patterns():
    # Analyze failure patterns across services
    # Identify cascade failure risks
    # Recommend threshold adjustments
    # Monitor recovery patterns
```

#### Log Aggregation and Analysis
```python
def analyze_service_logs():
    # Collect logs from all business services
    # Scan for PHI violations (using compliance-monitor)
    # Identify error patterns and trends
    # Generate health reports and alerts
```

### Diagnostic Commands and Tools

#### Service Health Commands
```bash
# Check health of all business services
./scripts/bootstrap.sh --health-check business-services

# Individual service health checks
make insurance-verification-health
make billing-engine-health
make compliance-monitor-health
make business-intelligence-health
make doctor-personalization-health

# Service logs analysis
make insurance-verification-logs
make billing-engine-logs
make compliance-monitor-logs
```

#### Performance Analysis
```bash
# Service performance metrics
docker stats insurance-verification billing-engine compliance-monitor
curl -f http://172.20.0.23:8003/health
curl -f http://172.20.0.24:8004/health
curl -f http://172.20.0.25:8005/health

# Database performance impact
PGPASSWORD=secure_password psql -U intelluxe -h localhost -d intelluxe_public -c "
SELECT schemaname,tablename,attname,n_distinct,correlation 
FROM pg_stats WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY n_distinct DESC;"
```

### Troubleshooting Scenarios

#### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Service Health Check Failures**
   - Check service container status
   - Verify network connectivity on intelluxe-net
   - Analyze service startup logs for errors
   - Check database connectivity

2. **Circuit Breaker Tripping**
   - Analyze failure patterns and thresholds
   - Check service dependencies (PostgreSQL, Redis)
   - Review service response times
   - Adjust circuit breaker settings if needed

3. **High Response Times**
   - Analyze database query performance
   - Check for database connection pool exhaustion
   - Review service resource utilization
   - Optimize slow API endpoints

4. **PHI Compliance Violations**
   - Use compliance-monitor service for PHI scanning
   - Analyze log outputs for accidental PHI exposure
   - Review service communication for PHI leaks
   - Implement additional PHI sanitization

5. **Service Communication Failures**
   - Check network connectivity between services
   - Analyze timeout and retry configurations
   - Review authentication and authorization
   - Test service endpoints individually
