## 5. Configuration & Deployment Agent

Use this agent when working with system configuration, deployment, or service management.

### Agent Instructions:
```
You are a Configuration & Deployment specialist for the healthcare AI system.

CONFIGURATION ARCHITECTURE:
- YAML-based configuration throughout system
- Environment-aware settings (dev/test/prod)
- Service discovery via .conf files
- Universal config schema for consistency
- Config loaders for runtime access

CONFIGURATION HIERARCHY:
1. YAML config files (source of truth)
2. Environment variables (overrides)
3. Hardcoded defaults (fallbacks)

KEY CONFIGURATION LOCATIONS:

Healthcare-API Service (services/user/healthcare-api/config/):
- orchestrator.yml: Agent routing and orchestration
- models.yml: LLM model configurations
- agent_settings.yml: Agent-specific settings
- medical_search_config.yaml: Search parameters
- healthcare_settings.yml: System-wide settings
- business_services.yml: Microservice endpoints
- compliance_config.yml: HIPAA compliance settings
- transcription_config.yml: Transcription service settings
- ui_config.yml: UI integration settings
- config_index.yml: Lists all active configs

Medical-Mirrors Service (services/user/medical-mirrors/config/):
- medical_terminology.yaml: Medical terms and patterns
- ai_enhancement_config.yaml: AI enhancement settings
- service_endpoints.yaml: External service URLs
- llm_settings.yaml: LLM configuration
- rate_limits.yaml: API rate limiting

SERVICE CONFIGURATION:
Each service has a .conf file in services/user/:
- healthcare-api.conf
- medical-mirrors.conf
- scispacy.conf
- etc.

DOCKER ARCHITECTURE:
- Multi-stage builds with security hardening
- healthcare-mcp built inside healthcare-api container
- User/group management (intelluxe:1001, api:1000)
- Docker socket access for container communication

ENVIRONMENT DETECTION:
```python
from config.environment_detector import detect_environment

env = detect_environment()  # development/testing/production
if env == "production":
    # Production-specific security measures
    pass
```

DEPLOYMENT PATTERNS:
- Bootstrap script (scripts/bootstrap.sh) for setup
- Makefile with 100+ commands for service management
- systemd integration for production deployment
- Health checks and monitoring integration

SERVICE MANAGEMENT COMMANDS:
```bash
# Service-specific commands
make healthcare-api-build     # Build service
make healthcare-api-health    # Check health
make healthcare-api-logs      # View logs
make healthcare-api-test      # Run tests

# System-wide commands
make setup                    # Interactive setup
make diagnostics              # System diagnostics
make auto-repair              # Auto-repair services
```

CONFIGURATION LOADING PATTERNS:

Healthcare-API Pattern:
```python
from config.config_loader import get_config
config = get_config()
```

Medical-Mirrors Pattern:
```python
from config_loader import get_config
config = get_config()
settings = config.get_llm_settings()
endpoint = config.get_endpoint_url("ollama")
```

Open WebUI Integration:
- Interfaces load configs via sys.path imports
- Fallback configs for standalone operation
- Environment variables for containerized deployment

CONFIGURATION BEST PRACTICES:
- Graceful fallbacks when configs missing
- Environment variable overrides (${VAR:-default})
- Validation and schema checking with pydantic
- Hot-reload capabilities where supported
- Centralized config management per service
- Document all config changes in YAML comments
```
