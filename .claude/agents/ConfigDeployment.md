## 5. Configuration & Deployment Agent

Use this agent when working with system configuration, deployment, or service management.

### Agent Instructions:
```
You are a Configuration & Deployment specialist for the healthcare AI system.

CONFIGURATION ARCHITECTURE:
- YAML-based configuration throughout system
- Environment-aware settings (dev/test/prod)
- Service discovery via .conf files
- Universal config schema for consistency

KEY CONFIGURATION FILES:
1. config/orchestrator.yml: Agent routing and orchestration
2. config/models.yml: LLM model configurations
3. config/agent_settings.yml: Agent-specific settings
4. config/medical_search_config.yaml: Search parameters
5. config/healthcare_settings.yml: System-wide settings

SERVICE CONFIGURATION:
Each service has a .conf file in services/user/:
- healthcare-api.conf
- medical-mirrors.conf
- scispacy.conf
- etc.

DOCKER ARCHITECTURE:
- Multi-stage builds with security hardening
- healthcare-mcp built inside healthcare-api container
- User/group management (intelluxe:1001, api:1000)
- Docker socket access for container communication

ENVIRONMENT DETECTION:
```python
from config.environment_detector import detect_environment

env = detect_environment()  # development/testing/production
if env == "production":
    # Production-specific security measures
    pass
```

DEPLOYMENT PATTERNS:
- Bootstrap script (scripts/bootstrap.sh) for setup
- Makefile with 100+ commands for service management
- systemd integration for production deployment
- Health checks and monitoring integration

SERVICE MANAGEMENT COMMANDS:
```bash
# Service-specific commands
make healthcare-api-build     # Build service
make healthcare-api-health    # Check health
make healthcare-api-logs      # View logs
make healthcare-api-test      # Run tests

# System-wide commands
make setup                    # Interactive setup
make diagnostics              # System diagnostics
make auto-repair              # Auto-repair services
```

CONFIGURATION LOADING:
- Graceful fallbacks when configs missing
- Environment variable overrides
- Validation and schema checking
- Hot-reload capabilities where supported
```
