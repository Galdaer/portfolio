## Implementation Examples

### Convert Single-Threaded Parser
```python
# Before: Single-threaded
from clinicaltrials.parser import ClinicalTrialsParser
parser = ClinicalTrialsParser()
for file in json_files:
    studies = parser.parse_json_file(file)

# After: Multi-core parallel
from clinicaltrials.parser_optimized import OptimizedClinicalTrialsParser
optimized_parser = OptimizedClinicalTrialsParser(max_workers=10)

# Process in parallel batches
batch_size = 10
file_batches = [json_files[i:i + batch_size] for i in range(0, len(json_files), batch_size)]
all_studies = await optimized_parser.parse_json_files_parallel(json_files)
```

### Deadlock-Resistant Database Operations
```python
import random
import time
from sqlalchemy import text

def retry_with_advisory_lock(func, lock_id, max_retries=5):
    """Retry database operations with PostgreSQL advisory locks"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # Acquire advisory lock
            lock_acquired = session.execute(
                text("SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock(:lock_id)"), 
                {"lock_id": lock_id}
            ).scalar()
            
            if not lock_acquired:
                wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
                time.sleep(wait_time)
                continue
                
            result = func()
            
            # Release advisory lock
            session.execute(
                text("SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(:lock_id)"), 
                {"lock_id": lock_id}
            )
            return result
            
        except Exception as e:
            if "deadlock" in str(e).lower():
                wait_time = (2 ** attempt) + random.uniform(0, 1)
                logger.warning(f"Deadlock detected, retrying in {wait_time:.2f}s (attempt {attempt + 1})")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
                continue
            raise
    
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded for deadlock resolution")
```

### Batch Processing Pattern
```python
from concurrent.futures import ProcessPoolExecutor, as_completed

def process_medical_data_parallel(data_files, max_workers=None):
    """Process medical data files in parallel batches"""
    if max_workers is None:
        max_workers = max(1, mp.cpu_count() // 2)
    
    logger.info(f"Processing {len(data_files)} files using {max_workers} workers")
    
    all_results = []
    with ProcessPoolExecutor(max_workers=max_workers) as executor:
        # Submit all tasks
        future_to_file = {
            executor.submit(process_single_file, file): file 
            for file in data_files
        }
        
        # Process completed tasks
        for future in as_completed(future_to_file):
            file_path = future_to_file[future]
            try:
                result = future.result()
                all_results.extend(result)
                logger.info(f"Completed processing: {file_path}")
            except Exception as e:
                logger.error(f"Failed to process {file_path}: {e}")
    
    return all_results
```
