# Healthcare AI System - Session Handoff Document
**Date:** August 14, 2025
**Context:** Critical LangChain Agent Scratchpad Bug Fix & MCP Infrastructure Debugging
**Repository:** intelluxe-core (branch: copilot/fix-222f6002-c434-456d-8224-50f652dcf487)

## üéØ SESSION OBJECTIVES & OUTCOMES

### What We Set Out to Accomplish:
- Fix critical LangChain agent error: "variable agent_scratchpad should be a list of base messages, got str"
- Resolve async/sync compatibility issues between LangChain tools and MCP client
- Improve type safety and eliminate MyPy errors in healthcare API components

### What We Actually Achieved:
- ‚úÖ **CRITICAL FIX**: Completely resolved LangChain agent scratchpad error
  - Switched from structured chat agent to ReAct agent  
  - Removed memory from AgentExecutor to prevent conflicts
  - Fixed async/sync tool compatibility with proper wrappers
  - Location: `services/user/healthcare-api/core/langchain/agents.py`

- ‚úÖ **Tool Compatibility**: Fixed async function execution in sync LangChain context
  - Created `_safe_tool_wrapper` with proper `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` detection
  - Ensured all tools return strings for LangChain compatibility
  - Location: `services/user/healthcare-api/core/langchain/tools.py`

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **MCP Infrastructure**: Identified broken pipe issue in MCP connections
  - Agent now works correctly but MCP server has connectivity issues
  - Requires investigation of container networking or MCP server stability
  - Connection failures manifest as "[Errno 32] Broken pipe"

- ‚ùå **MyPy Clean-up**: Deferred due to focus on critical agent fix
  - 883 MyPy errors remain across the healthcare API (pre-existing issues)
  - No new type errors introduced by agent fixes

## üí° KEY DISCOVERIES & DECISIONS

### Technical Breakthroughs:
- **LangChain 0.3.x Incompatibility**: Structured chat agents with ConversationSummaryBufferMemory cause scratchpad type conflicts
  - Problem it solves: Eliminates runtime agent failures 
  - Implementation pattern: Use ReAct agent without memory, only pass `{"input": query}` to `ainvoke()`
  - Files affected: `core/langchain/agents.py`, `core/langchain/tools.py`

- **Async/Sync Bridge Pattern**: LangChain requires sync functions but MCP tools are async
  - Problem it solves: Prevents "coroutine was never awaited" warnings
  - Implementation pattern: Detect async functions with `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` and wrap with `asyncio.run()`
  - Files affected: `core/langchain/tools.py`

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Agent Architecture Simplification**: Moved from complex structured chat to proven ReAct pattern
  - Rationale: Better LangChain 0.3.x compatibility, simpler debugging, fewer edge cases
  - Impact: More reliable agent execution, easier maintenance

## üîß CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Working Solutions (DON'T BREAK THESE!):

- **LangChain Agent Initialization**:
  - Location: `services/user/healthcare-api/core/langchain/agents.py:134-170`
  - Pattern: 
    ```python
    from langchain import hub
    from langchain.agents import create_react_agent
    
    prompt = hub.pull("hwchase17/react")
    agent = create_react_agent(llm=self.llm, tools=self.tools, prompt=prompt)
    self.executor = AgentExecutor(
        agent=agent,
        tools=self.tools,
        verbose=True,
        return_intermediate_steps=True,
        handle_parsing_errors="Check your output and make sure it conforms!"
        # NO memory parameter
        # NO early_stopping_method="generate"
    )
    ```
  - Why it works: ReAct agent manages scratchpad internally without memory conflicts

- **Async Tool Wrapper**:
  - Location: `services/user/healthcare-api/core/langchain/tools.py:49-85`
  - Pattern: Uses `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction()` detection and proper thread executor handling
  - Why it works: Properly bridges async MCP calls to sync LangChain expectations

### Known Issues & Workarounds:

- **MCP Broken Pipe Error**: "[Errno 32] Broken pipe" in MCP tool calls
  - Temporary fix: Agent handles tool failures gracefully and continues execution
  - Proper solution: Investigate MCP server container networking, resource limits, or subprocess spawning issues
  - Debug approach: Test MCP connectivity independently, check container logs, verify stdio streams

## üìã UPDATED PHASE ALIGNMENT

### Phase 1 (Current) Status:
- **LangChain Agent Core**: 95% complete - agent processing works, MCP connectivity needs fixing
- **Type Safety**: 60% complete - critical areas fixed, broader cleanup deferred
- **MCP Integration**: 80% complete - tools work but connection stability issues remain

### Phase 2 Preparation:
- **Agent Orchestration**: Ready - single agent works, can now build agent coordination
- **Memory Management**: Architecture clarified - use external memory rather than LangChain built-in
- **Tool Ecosystem**: Foundation solid - pattern established for adding more medical tools

### Phase 3 Considerations:
- **Production Deployment**: Will need robust MCP connection handling and retry logic
- **Scalability**: Current single-agent pattern ready for horizontal scaling

## üöÄ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### Immediate (Must Do):
1. **Investigate MCP Broken Pipe Issue**
   - Acceptance criteria: MCP tools return actual data instead of connection errors
   - Debug steps: Check container networking, MCP server logs, stdio stream handling
   - Priority: High - blocks full agent functionality

### Important (Should Do):
2. **Test Agent with Real Medical Queries**
   - Verify agent behavior with complex multi-step medical research queries
   - Ensure tool chaining works correctly in ReAct pattern
   - Test error recovery and graceful degradation

3. **Add Integration Test for Agent Fix**
   - Create automated test that verifies scratchpad error doesn't return
   - Include in CI pipeline to prevent regression

### Nice to Have (Could Do):
4. **MyPy Error Cleanup Campaign**
   - Tackle the 883 existing MyPy errors systematically
   - Focus on healthcare-specific modules first for safety

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

### DO NOT CHANGE:
- **ReAct Agent Pattern in `agents.py`** - This fixes the scratchpad error. Reverting to structured chat will break agent processing
- **Tool Wrapper Logic in `tools.py`** - The async detection and wrapping prevents LangChain compatibility issues
- **AgentExecutor Configuration** - No memory parameter, specific handle_parsing_errors string

### BE CAREFUL WITH:
- **LangChain Version Updates** - Current fix is specific to 0.3.x series, major version changes may require pattern updates
- **MCP Client Modifications** - Connection issues may tempt major refactoring, but current client logic is sound
- **Prompt Template Changes** - ReAct prompt from hub is proven, custom prompts may reintroduce issues

### DEPENDENCIES TO MAINTAIN:
- **LangChain 0.3.x series** - agent patterns validated for this version
- **Python 3.12** - asyncio behavior depends on current Python version
- **Ollama local deployment** - healthcare compliance requires local-only LLM execution

## üîÑ ENVIRONMENT & CONFIGURATION STATE

### Current Configuration:
- **Development mode**: Local Ollama + MCP server in containers
- **Key environment variables**: 
  - `OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434`
  - `HEALTHCARE_AGENT_DEBUG=true` (optional, enables verbose logging)
- **Service dependencies**: Ollama server must be running, MCP server container should be accessible

### Required Tools/Services:
- **Ollama**: Latest version with llama3.1:8b model - local LLM execution
- **Docker**: For MCP server container - tool execution environment  
- **Node.js**: In MCP container for healthcare-mcp tool server
- **Python 3.12**: With specific package versions in requirements.txt

## üìù CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT

### Where We Left Off:
LangChain agent is fully functional for processing queries and will iterate through tools, but MCP tool calls fail with broken pipe errors. The agent gracefully handles these failures and completes execution. The core scratchpad bug that was blocking all agent functionality is completely resolved.

### Recommended Starting Point:
1. Run `python3 test_langchain_fix.py` to verify agent works without scratchpad errors
2. Focus on `services/user/healthcare-api/core/mcp/` directory for connection debugging
3. Check MCP server container logs: `docker logs healthcare-mcp`

### Success Criteria for Next Session:
- [ ] MCP tools return actual medical data instead of "Tool error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe"
- [ ] Agent can successfully complete a medical query with real PubMed results
- [ ] Integration test passes showing end-to-end functionality

## üîç MCP Broken Pipe Investigation Guide

### Symptoms Observed:
```
Failed to call MCP tool search-pubmed: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
Failed to call MCP tool search_pubmed: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
Tool error: [Errno 32] Broken pipe
```

### Investigation Steps:
1. **Check MCP Server Status**:
   ```bash
   docker ps | grep healthcare-mcp
   docker logs healthcare-mcp --tail=50
   ```

2. **Test MCP Server Directly**:
   ```bash
   docker exec -it healthcare-mcp node /app/build/index.js
   # Should show MCP server startup messages
   ```

3. **Verify Container Networking**:
   ```bash
   docker network ls
   docker network inspect <network_name>
   ```

4. **Check Resource Constraints**:
   ```bash
   docker stats healthcare-mcp
   # Look for memory/CPU limits being hit
   ```

5. **Test Stdio Communication**:
   - MCP uses stdin/stdout for communication
   - Broken pipe suggests stdio stream closure
   - May need to switch from container exec to subprocess spawning

### Potential Root Causes:
- **Container Resource Limits**: MCP server running out of memory/CPU
- **Stdio Stream Issues**: Container exec doesn't provide proper stdio streams
- **MCP Server Crashes**: Internal errors causing server termination
- **Network Connectivity**: Container-to-container communication problems
- **Process Lifecycle**: MCP server process not properly handling stdio lifecycle

### Next Steps for MCP Fix:
1. **Switch to Single-Container Deployment**: Move MCP server into same container as Python API
2. **Use Process Spawning**: Replace docker exec with subprocess.Popen for MCP communication  
3. **Add Robust Error Handling**: Implement connection pooling and retry logic
4. **Monitor Resource Usage**: Ensure MCP server has adequate resources

This broken pipe issue is the final barrier to full agent functionality. Once resolved, the healthcare AI system will have a fully working LangChain agent capable of medical literature search and reasoning.
