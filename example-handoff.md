f# Healthcare AI System - Session Handoff Document
**Date:** 2025-08-14
**Context:** Debugging Open WebUI response gap: medical literature results found but not rendered; ensured agent always returns human-readable summary and non-blocking multi-agent orchestration.
**Repository:** intelluxe-core (branch: copilot/fix-222f6002-c434-456d-8224-50f652dcf487)

## üéØ SESSION OBJECTIVES & OUTCOMES
### What We Set Out to Accomplish:
- Diagnose why Open WebUI showed "processed but no clear response" despite successful literature retrieval.
- Ensure medical_search agent produces a formatted human-readable response.
- Preserve results in multi-agent orchestration even when other agents fail.

### What We Actually Achieved:
- ‚úÖ Confirmed MCP search returns many articles; pipeline reaches agent with valid data.
- ‚úÖ Identified formatting pathway gaps and added non-blocking guards around instrumentation.
- ‚úÖ Documented agent contract: always set `formatted_summary` with safe fallback.
- ‚úÖ Updated instructions: language, domain, workflows, and agent-specific.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial: Need to audit all metrics calls across agents for non-blocking behavior.
- ‚ùå Deferred: Full UI synthesis of multiple agent results with partial failures.

## üí° KEY DISCOVERIES & DECISIONS
### Technical Breakthroughs:
- Non-blocking Metrics in Agents: Metrics/logging must never block summary generation.
  - Problem it solves: Response formatting silently skipped when metrics raised exceptions.
  - Implementation pattern: Wrap `AgentMetricsStore.incr/record_timing` in try/except.
  - Files affected: `services/user/healthcare-api/agents/medical_search_agent/medical_search_agent.py` (lines ~165-171, 216-221).

- Resilient Summary Contract: Always provide `formatted_summary` with minimal fallback.
  - Problem it solves: UI displayed generic message due to missing `formatted_summary`.
  - Implementation pattern: Surround formatting with try/except and build fallback summary.
  - Files affected: `medical_search_agent.py` (lines ~172-189), `core/medical/url_utils.py` (summary helpers).

### Architecture Decisions:
- UI Contract Enforcement: Agents that surface in Open WebUI must set `formatted_summary`.
- Multi-Agent Non-Blocking: Preserve successful agent outputs even if peers fail; synthesis should treat failures as partial data, not blockers.

## üîß CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
### Working Solutions (DON'T BREAK THESE!):
- Medical Search Formatting Guard:
  - Location: `services/user/healthcare-api/agents/medical_search_agent/medical_search_agent.py:172-189`
  - Pattern: try format; on exception, log and set minimal fallback string.
  - Why it works: Guarantees UI gets a readable summary.

- Metrics Isolation:
  - Location: `medical_search_agent.py:165-171`, `214-221`
  - Pattern: Wrap metrics in try/except.
  - Why it works: Prevents telemetry issues from blocking outputs.

### Known Issues & Workarounds:
- Issue: Other agents may still be selected by router; their failure could overshadow search output in synthesis.
  - Temporary fix: Documented requirement to preserve per-agent summaries; ensure pipeline prefers populated `formatted_summary`.
  - Proper solution: Implement orchestration layer to merge available summaries and surface best available result with provenance.

## üìã UPDATED PHASE ALIGNMENT
### Phase 1 (Current) Status:
- Medical Search Agent: 90% complete ‚Äì robust retrieval and formatting with fallbacks.
- MCP Pipeline: 80% ‚Äì prioritizes `formatted_summary`; needs multi-agent merge helpers.

### Phase 2 Preparation:
- Ready: Agent diagnostics, YAML intent patterns, stdio timeouts.
- Needed: Result synthesizer that aggregates multiple agent summaries.

### Phase 3 Considerations:
- Long-term: Evidence quality scoring across agents and conflict resolution.

## üöÄ NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES
### Immediate (Must Do):
1. Implement non-blocking result synthesis in router/pipeline: merge `formatted_summary` from all responding agents with provenance. Acceptance: UI shows medical_search results even if clinical_research fails.

### Important (Should Do):
2. Add unit tests for formatting fallbacks and DIAGNOSTIC logs.
3. Audit metrics calls across all agents for non-blocking behavior.

### Nice to Have (Could Do):
4. Expand intent templates in `medical_query_patterns.yaml` for drugs/guidelines.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS
### DO NOT CHANGE:
- The guarantee that `formatted_summary` is always present in medical_search responses.

### BE CAREFUL WITH:
- MCP concurrency settings and timeouts; raising concurrency can cause stdio contention.

### DEPENDENCIES TO MAINTAIN:
- Python tooling: mypy, ruff/flake8, black, isort; configs in repo.

## üîÑ ENVIRONMENT & CONFIGURATION STATE
### Current Configuration:
- Development mode: Local MCP server (stdio), Ollama local LLM client.
- Key environment variables: Agent routing and MCP timeouts via search config.
- Service dependencies: healthcare-api service, MCP server, Open WebUI.

### Required Tools/Services:
- Python 3.11+ (verify in CI), MyPy configured via mypy.ini, Black/Isort for formatting.

## üìù CONTEXT FOR NEXT AGENT
### Where We Left Off:
MCP queries return articles, medical_search formats results with fallback; need orchestration to preserve this summary when other agents are also in play.

### Recommended Starting Point:
`services/user/healthcare-api/main.py` router/synthesis path and `services/user/mcp-pipeline/pipelines/MCP_pipeline.py` response extraction.

### Success Criteria for Next Session:
- UI consistently shows human-readable literature results from `medical_search` even when other agents fail or time out.
