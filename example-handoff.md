# Healthcare AI System - Medical Search Result Formatting Handoff (2025-08-13)

Repository: intelluxe-core (branch: copilot/fix-222f6002-c434-456d-8224-50f652dcf487)

## ‚úÖ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: MCP Integration Working

**What We Successfully Completed**:
1. **MCP STDIO Handshake**: ‚úÖ Fixed and working - medical search agent successfully calls MCP tools
2. **Agent Integration**: ‚úÖ Complete - Open WebUI ‚Üí healthcare-api ‚Üí medical_search_agent ‚Üí MCP tools
3. **AttributeError**: ‚úÖ RESOLVED - `_ensure_connected()` method exists and works correctly

**Evidence of Success**:
- Open WebUI shows successful search with `'status': 'success'` responses
- Agent logs show `MCP connection established successfully` 
- Healthcare API routing requests to medical_search_agent which uses MCP tools correctly
- Debug logs confirm: `MCP client debug - has _ensure_connected: True`

**‚ö†Ô∏è NEW ISSUE DISCOVERED**: MCP Transport Layer Instability
- **Symptom**: `MCP call completed successfully, got 0 articles` 
- **Root Cause**: `RuntimeError: unable to perform operation on WriteUnixTransport closed=True`
- **Impact**: MCP calls start successfully but transport fails during execution

## üéØ NEW MISSION: Human-Readable Medical Search Results

**Current State**: Raw JSON search results need formatting into readable medical literature summaries.

**Open WebUI Currently Shows**:
```json
{
  "status": "success", 
  "result": {
    "success": true, 
    "search_id": "aeaf7930978b", 
    "search_query": "Can you help me find recent articles on cardiovascular health?",
    "information_sources": [], 
    "related_conditions": [], 
    "drug_information": [], 
    "clinical_references": [],
    "search_confidence": 0.0,
    "disclaimers": ["Search request timed out after 25 seconds"],
    "total_sources": 0
  }
}
```

**Goal**: Transform this into human-readable medical literature summaries with proper formatting.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture That Works (Don't Change)

**PROVEN WORKING ARCHITECTURE**:
```
Open WebUI ‚Üí HTTP Client ‚Üí FastAPI (main.py) ‚Üí Agent Router ‚Üí medical_search_agent ‚Üí healthcare_mcp_client.py ‚Üí MCP Server
```

**Key Working Components**:
- **main.py**: Pure FastAPI HTTP server with agent routing (NO stdio code)
- **healthcare_mcp_client.py**: All MCP stdio communication and tool access
- **medical_search_agent**: Successfully calls MCP tools and returns structured JSON

## üìÇ Critical Files to Modify

### Primary Target Files:
1. **`services/user/healthcare-api/agents/medical_search_agent/medical_search_agent.py`**
   - Current: Returns raw JSON with empty arrays
   - Needed: Transform MCP results into readable summaries
   - Key methods: `search_medical_literature()`, `format_search_results()`

2. **`services/user/healthcare-api/agents/medical_search_agent/search_utilities.py`**
   - Current: Basic search term extraction
   - Needed: Result formatting and medical disclaimer generation
   - Key methods: `format_medical_literature_results()`, `generate_medical_disclaimers()`

### Supporting Files:
3. **`services/user/healthcare-api/core/mcp/healthcare_mcp_client.py`**
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working perfectly - DO NOT MODIFY
   - Methods: `call_healthcare_tool()`, `get_available_tools()`

4. **`services/user/healthcare-mcp/src/stdio_entry.ts`**
   - Status: ‚úÖ Working perfectly - DO NOT MODIFY
   - Purpose: Clean stdio entry point for MCP communication

## üö´ What NOT to Change (Working Components)

**‚ùå DO NOT MODIFY THESE WORKING COMPONENTS**:
- MCP stdio handshake code (healthcare_mcp_client.py)
- Container startup commands or Dockerfile
- stdio_entry.ts or index.ts in healthcare-mcp
- FastAPI routing in main.py
- Agent discovery and loading mechanisms

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: MCP integration is working. Focus only on result formatting, not communication.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

**Why Empty Results?**:
1. **‚úÖ RESOLVED**: AttributeError on `_ensure_connected()` - method exists and works correctly
2. **üÜï TRANSPORT LAYER ISSUE**: MCP stdio transport failing during execution
   - `RuntimeError: unable to perform operation on WriteUnixTransport closed=True`
   - Calls start successfully but transport fails before completion
   - Results in `MCP call completed successfully, got 0 articles` 
3. **Connection Instability**: Transport layer not maintaining stable stdio connection

**Evidence from Latest Logs (2025-08-13 20:27)**:
```
2025-08-13 20:27:55,041 - MCP connection established successfully
2025-08-13 20:27:55,094 - MCP call completed successfully, got 0 articles
2025-08-13 20:27:55,091 - Failed to call tool search-pubmed: unhandled errors in a TaskGroup (WriteUnixTransport closed=True)
```

## üìã Specific Tasks for Next Agent

### Task 1: Fix MCP Transport Layer Stability 
```python
# Investigation needed in healthcare_mcp_client.py
# Issue: WriteUnixTransport closed during MCP calls
# Solution: Add connection retry/reconnection logic

# Debug approach:
1. Add transport state logging before/after calls
2. Implement connection pooling or retry mechanism  
3. Check if docker exec process is terminating prematurely
```

### Task 2: Add Connection Health Monitoring
```python
# In medical_search_agent.py - add transport health checks
try:
    # Check transport state before call
    if hasattr(self.mcp_client, '_check_transport_health'):
        await self.mcp_client._check_transport_health()
    
    result = await asyncio.wait_for(
        self.mcp_client.call_healthcare_tool("search-pubmed", {"query": concept}),
        timeout=30  # Increased from 10s
    )
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Transport error details: {type(e).__name__}: {e}")
    # Add reconnection logic here
```

### Task 2: Add Result Debugging
```python
# Add before timeout to see what MCP actually returns
logger.info(f"Raw MCP result for {concept}: {result}")
if isinstance(result, dict) and 'content' in result:
    logger.info(f"MCP content type: {type(result['content'])}")
```

### Task 3: Implement Result Parsing
```python
# In search_utilities.py - create new method
def parse_mcp_search_results(raw_mcp_result: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """Parse raw MCP tool results into structured medical literature entries."""
    # Extract actual search results from MCP response
    # Transform into readable format with titles, abstracts, DOIs
    pass
```

### Task 4: Human-Readable Response Formatting
```python
# Create method to format final response
def format_medical_search_response(
    search_results: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    query: str
) -> str:
    """Format search results into human-readable medical literature summary."""
    # Create readable summary with:
    # - Search query interpretation
    # - Key findings from literature
    # - Related conditions and treatments
    # - Proper medical disclaimers
    pass
```

## üìö Relevant Instruction Files

**Primary Instructions to Reference**:
1. **`.github/instructions/medical-search-agent.instructions.md`** - Updated with working patterns
2. **`.github/instructions/mcp-stdio-handshake.instructions.md`** - Validated MCP patterns
3. **`.github/instructions/tasks/healthcare-logging.instructions.md`** - PHI-safe logging

## üß™ Testing Strategy

### Validate MCP Communication:
```bash
# Confirm MCP still works
python3 scripts/mcp_pubmed_probe.py --list-only

# Test via Open WebUI with cardiovascular health query
# Check logs in: logs/agent_medical_search.log
```

### Debug Result Processing:
1. Add logging to see raw MCP results
2. Test with shorter, specific medical terms
3. Verify timeout handling vs actual data processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Success Criteria

**Must Achieve**:
1. **Human-Readable Results**: Users see formatted medical literature summaries, not raw JSON
2. **Medical Disclaimers**: All results include appropriate healthcare disclaimers
3. **Preserve MCP Integration**: Don't break existing working MCP communication
4. **Timeout Handling**: Better user messages for API timeouts vs actual failures

**Success Looks Like**:
```
üè• Medical Search Agent Response:

Based on your query about cardiovascular health, I found the following recent research:

**Key Findings:**
‚Ä¢ [Recent study title] - [Brief summary]
‚Ä¢ [Treatment guidance] - [Evidence-based summary]

**Related Conditions:**
‚Ä¢ Hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure

**Important Medical Disclaimer:**
This information is for educational purposes only and should not replace professional medical advice...
```

## üìä Performance Expectations

**Current Performance**: MCP calls timeout after 10s
**Target Performance**: 30s timeout with async result processing
**Fallback Strategy**: Show partial results if some MCP calls succeed

## üîß Development Environment

**Working Container Setup**:
- healthcare-mcp: Running with 16 registered tools
- healthcare-api: Agent routing functional
- Open WebUI: Successfully communicating with healthcare-api

**Test Command**:
```bash
# Quick test that MCP still works
make mcp-rebuild && python3 scripts/mcp_pubmed_probe.py --call-pubmed
```
