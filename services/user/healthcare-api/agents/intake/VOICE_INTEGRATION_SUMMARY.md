## Voice-to-Form Processing Workflow

### 1. Session Initialization
```python
# Start voice intake session
voice_session_id = await start_voice_intake(
    patient_id="PAT_001",
    intake_type="new_patient_registration"
)
```

### 2. Real-Time Processing
```python
# Process voice chunks as they arrive
result = await process_voice_input(
    voice_session_id=session_id,
    audio_data=audio_chunk
)
```

### 3. Form Population
- **Intelligent Parsing**: Extracts structured data from natural speech
- **Field Mapping**: Maps speech patterns to form fields
- **Progressive Completion**: Tracks completion percentage in real-time
- **Medical Context**: Preserves medical terminology and clinical context

### 4. Session Finalization
```python
# Complete voice intake and generate standard intake result
final_result = await complete_voice_intake(voice_session_id)
```

## HIPAA Compliance Features

## Usage Examples

### Basic Voice Intake
```python
# Initialize agent
intake_agent = HealthcareIntakeAgent(mcp_client, llm_client)
await intake_agent.initialize()

# Start voice intake
response = await intake_agent.process_request({
    "start_voice_intake": True,
    "patient_id": "PAT_001",
    "intake_type": "new_patient_registration"
})

# Process voice input
voice_response = await intake_agent.process_request({
    "voice_session_id": voice_session_id,
    "audio_data": {
        "data": audio_chunk,
        "format": "webm",
        "duration": 2.5
    }
})

# Complete intake
final_response = await intake_agent.process_request({
    "complete_voice_intake": True,
    "voice_session_id": voice_session_id
})
```

### Advanced Voice Processing
- **Multi-Modal Input**: Combines voice and traditional form input
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Allows switching between voice and manual entry
