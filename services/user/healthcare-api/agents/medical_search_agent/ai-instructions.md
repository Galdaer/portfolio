### PHI Protection
- Uses `@phi_monitor` decorator for search query processing
- Calls `scan_for_phi()` to detect potential PHI in search queries
- Implements appropriate safeguards for medical content processing
- Maintains PHI safety throughout search workflows

### Integration Points
- FastAPI router at `/search/*` endpoints
- Medical database and literature service integration
- Clinical reference database access
- Healthcare logging infrastructure
- PHI monitoring system
