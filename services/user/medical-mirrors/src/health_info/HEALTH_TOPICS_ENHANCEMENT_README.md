## Architecture

### AI-First Design
```python
# Primary AI enhancement using SciSpacy + Ollama
if ai_services_available:
    enhanced_data = await ai_enhance_topics(topics)
else:
    enhanced_data = pattern_enhance_topics(topics)  # Fallback
```

### Fallback Strategy
- **Pattern-Based Enhancement**: Uses medical terminology patterns when AI unavailable
- **Configuration-Driven**: Enable/disable via `ai_enhancement_config.yaml`
- **Graceful Degradation**: Always provides enhanced content, even without AI

### Integration Points
1. **Parser Integration**: Automatic enhancement during parsing
2. **Smart Downloader**: Post-download enhancement processing
3. **Configuration System**: Centralized settings management
4. **Database Ready**: Enhanced fields prepared for future database migration
