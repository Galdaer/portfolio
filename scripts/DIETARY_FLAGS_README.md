# Dietary Flags Implementation for Food Items Database

## Overview

This implementation enhances the `food_items` table with professional dietary classifications based on authoritative government sources (USDA/FDA). All 7,353 food items now include comprehensive dietary flags with proper disclaimers and data source attribution.

## Implementation Details

### Data Sources
- **MyPlate Food Groups**: USDA MyPlate Guidelines
- **Nutritional Claims**: FDA Code of Federal Regulations Title 21
- **Allergen Detection**: FDA FALCPA (Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act) and FASTER Act (2021)

### Key Features

#### 1. MyPlate Food Group Classification
Foods are automatically classified into the five official MyPlate food groups:
- **Vegetables** (15.8% of foods): Includes legumes per MyPlate guidelines
- **Fruits** (5.2% of foods): All fruit products and 100% fruit juices
- **Grains** (14.9% of foods): Cereals, pasta, baked products, rice dishes
- **Protein** (17.8% of foods): Meat, poultry, fish, nuts, seeds, eggs
- **Dairy** (6.7% of foods): Milk products, cheese, yogurt
- **Other** (39.6% of foods): Mixed dishes, beverages, sweets, fats

#### 2. FDA Nutritional Claims
Using official FDA thresholds from CFR Title 21:
- **Low Sodium**: <140mg per serving (40.2% of foods)
- **Low Fat**: <3g per serving (42.7% of foods) 
- **Fat Free**: <0.5g per serving (22.0% of foods)
- **Sodium Free**: <5mg per serving (12.6% of foods)
- **Good Source of Fiber**: ≥2.5g per serving (28.2% of foods)
- **High Fiber**: ≥5g per serving (12.4% of foods)
- **High Protein**: ≥10g per serving (28.8% of foods)
- **Low Calorie**: ≤40 calories per serving (6.5% of foods)
- **Calorie Free**: ≤5 calories per serving (3.2% of foods)

#### 3. FDA Allergen Detection
Comprehensive detection of all 9 major FDA allergens:
- **Milk** (18.5% detection rate): Dairy products, cheese, yogurt
- **Wheat** (5.5% detection rate): Grain products, flour-based items
- **Eggs** (3.4% detection rate): Egg products, baked goods with eggs
- **Fish** (3.0% detection rate): All fish products and dishes
- **Soybeans** (2.7% detection rate): Soy products, tofu, miso
- **Tree Nuts** (2.1% detection rate): Almonds, walnuts, cashews, etc.
- **Peanuts** (1.4% detection rate): Peanut products and dishes
- **Shellfish** (1.4% detection rate): Shrimp, lobster, crab, etc.
- **Sesame** (0.5% detection rate): Sesame products (FASTER Act 2021)

### Database Structure

Each food item now has an enhanced `dietary_flags` JSONB column containing:

```json
{
    "myplate_food_group": "vegetables",
    "fda_nutritional_claims": ["low_sodium", "low_fat", "high_fiber"],
    "potential_allergens": ["milk", "wheat"],
    "data_sources": {
        "myplate_mapping": "USDA MyPlate Guidelines",
        "nutritional_claims": "FDA CFR Title 21",
        "allergen_detection": "FDA FALCPA/FASTER Act"
    },
    "disclaimers": {
        "allergen_disclaimer": "Allergen detection based on text parsing. Not a substitute for official allergen labeling.",
        "nutritional_disclaimer": "Nutritional claims calculated from available nutrient data. Verify with official product labeling.",
        "last_updated": "2025-08-29"
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Query Foods by MyPlate Group
```sql
-- Get all vegetables
SELECT description, food_category 
FROM food_items 
WHERE dietary_flags->>'myplate_food_group' = 'vegetables';
```

### Find Foods with Specific Nutritional Claims
```sql
-- Low sodium, high protein foods
SELECT description, dietary_flags->'fda_nutritional_claims' 
FROM food_items 
WHERE dietary_flags->'fda_nutritional_claims' ? 'low_sodium'
  AND dietary_flags->'fda_nutritional_claims' ? 'high_protein';
```

### Allergen-Free Food Search
```sql
-- Dairy-free protein sources
SELECT description, dietary_flags->'potential_allergens'
FROM food_items 
WHERE dietary_flags->>'myplate_food_group' = 'protein'
  AND NOT (dietary_flags->'potential_allergens' ? 'milk');
```

### Complex Dietary Queries
```sql
-- High-fiber grains without wheat
SELECT description, food_category
FROM food_items 
WHERE dietary_flags->>'myplate_food_group' = 'grains'
  AND dietary_flags->'fda_nutritional_claims' ? 'high_fiber'
  AND NOT (dietary_flags->'potential_allergens' ? 'wheat');
```

## Data Quality Metrics

- **Coverage**: 100% of food items (7,353/7,353)
- **Professional Classification**: 60.4% classified into specific MyPlate groups
- **Rich Nutritional Data**: 33.3% with 3+ FDA nutritional claims
- **Allergen Intelligence**: 34.3% with potential allergen detections

## Professional Standards Compliance

### FDA Nutritional Claims
All nutritional claims strictly follow FDA regulations:
- Based on actual nutrient analysis from USDA data
- Uses official FDA thresholds from CFR Title 21
- Includes proper serving size considerations
- Maintains full audit trail and source attribution

### USDA MyPlate Integration
Food group classifications align with official USDA MyPlate guidelines:
- Legumes classified as vegetables (official MyPlate rule)
- Dairy products properly separated from protein
- Mixed dishes categorized by primary component
- Professional healthcare dietary planning compatible

### Allergen Detection Accuracy
Allergen detection follows FDA FALCPA requirements:
- Covers all 9 major allergens including sesame (FASTER Act 2021)
- Text-based parsing with clear disclaimers
- Not intended as substitute for official product labeling
- Useful for preliminary dietary screening and research

## Maintenance and Updates

### Regular Validation
Run validation queries monthly:
```bash
psql -f /home/intelluxe/scripts/validate_dietary_flags.sql
```

### Summary Reports
Generate comprehensive reports:
```bash
python3 /home/intelluxe/scripts/dietary_flags_summary_report.py
```

### Re-implementation
If needed, re-run the complete implementation:
```bash
python3 /home/intelluxe/scripts/update_dietary_flags.py
```

## Important Disclaimers

1. **Not Medical Advice**: These classifications are for informational and research purposes only
2. **Allergen Limitations**: Allergen detection is text-based parsing, not laboratory analysis
3. **Nutritional Claims**: Based on available USDA nutrient data, may not reflect all product variations
4. **Professional Verification**: Always verify with official product labeling for clinical use
5. **Data Currency**: Classifications based on data available as of 2025-08-29

## Technical Specifications

- **Performance**: Indexed on `dietary_flags` using GIN indexes
- **Storage**: ~50KB additional storage per 1,000 food items
- **Query Performance**: Optimized for common dietary filtering scenarios
- **Scalability**: Functions support batch processing for future expansions
