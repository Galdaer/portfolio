# Diagnostic Queries for Healthcare Literature Search

## Simple queries to test different components:

1. "cardiovascular health" - Test basic medical term search
2. "heart disease" - Test condition-specific search  
3. "diabetes treatment" - Test treatment-focused search
4. "recent cancer research" - Test time-based filtering
5. "covid vaccine studies" - Test specific medical topic

## Expected behavior:
- Agent should retrieve medical literature
- PHI detection should NOT sanitize author names in medical context
- Response should show formatted article listings, not raw JSON
- Pipeline should prioritize formatted_summary over formatted_response

## Debug checkpoints:
- MCP calls succeed ✓ (confirmed in logs)
- Articles parsed correctly ✓ (confirmed in logs) 
- Response formatting ? (needs investigation)
- PHI processing ? (needs investigation)
- Pipeline response selection ? (needs investigation)
