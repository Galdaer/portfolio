# Intelluxe AI Healthcare Security Assessment

## Container Vulnerability Mitigation

### Network Isolation Security Model
- **PHI Processing**: Occurs in isolated Docker network (intelluxe-net)
- **External Access**: Only through Traefik TLS proxy with certificate validation
- **Data Flow**: No PHI leaves local network infrastructure
- **Threat Model**: Container CVEs require local network access to exploit

### Vulnerability Assessment Summary
- **Base OS Vulnerabilities**: Mitigated by network isolation and non-root execution
- **Python Package CVEs**: Limited blast radius due to healthcare user restrictions
- **Attack Surface**: Minimal - only transcription API endpoints exposed
- **Compliance**: HIPAA-compliant deployment model with audit logging

### Risk Assessment for Clinical Deployment
- **High**: Network-based attacks (mitigated by Traefik + TLS)
- **Medium**: Container escape (mitigated by non-root user + read-only volumes)
- **Low**: Package vulnerabilities (mitigated by network isolation)
- **Negligible**: Base OS CVEs in isolated deployment

## Recommendation for Healthcare Clients
The **Intelluxe AI deployment model** provides superior security compared to cloud alternatives through:
1. Complete PHI data control (no cloud exposure)
2. Network isolation (private clinical infrastructure)
3. Audit transparency (full source code + container visibility)
4. Update control (client manages security patches)
