Missing Healthcare Infrastructure Components

## CRITICAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS:

### 1. MCP Client Implementation
- Need actual HealthcareMCPClient in core/mcp/healthcare_mcp_client.py
- Connect to our mcps/healthcare/ server
- Healthcare tool integration (medical entity extraction, literature search)

### 2. Authentication & Authorization  
- JWT token authentication for healthcare access
- Role-based access control (Doctor, Nurse, Admin)
- HIPAA compliance audit logging

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Healthcare-specific error codes
- Patient safety error responses  
- Detailed audit logging for compliance

### 4. Background Task Processing
- Long-running medical analysis (differential diagnosis)
- Medical literature research (can take 30+ seconds)
- Insurance verification workflows

### 5. Caching Strategy
- Medical literature cache (Redis)
- Drug interaction cache
- Patient context cache (session-based)

### 6. Request Validation
- Medical data validation (dates, measurements)
- PHI detection and protection
- Healthcare form validation

### 7. Monitoring & Health Checks
- Service health monitoring
- Database connection monitoring  
- MCP server connectivity checks
- LLM availability checks

### 8. Configuration Management
- Environment-specific configs
- Healthcare compliance settings
- Model configuration (temperature, max_tokens)

## NICE-TO-HAVE OPTIMIZATIONS:

### 9. Response Streaming
- Stream long medical literature responses
- Real-time AI reasoning updates

### 10. Rate Limiting
- Protect against abuse
- Healthcare-appropriate limits

### 11. API Documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI enhancements
- Healthcare compliance notes
- Medical disclaimers

### 12. Testing Infrastructure  
- Integration tests with real MCP/LLM
- Healthcare workflow tests
- Load testing for clinical environments
