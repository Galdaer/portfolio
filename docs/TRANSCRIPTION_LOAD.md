Sending audio snippets from the Windows client to the server for transcription is generally the preferred architectural pattern—especially if:

- The server has more resources (CPU/GPU/RAM) and can run larger, more accurate transcription models (like Whisper large or similar).
- Centralizing transcription means you can update, control, and secure the model in one place.
- Data does not reside or get processed on potentially insecure endpoints (Windows laptops, etc.), which is a privacy/security win.

### **Pros of Server-Side Transcription**
- **Better Model Performance:** You can use larger models for better accuracy.
- **Centralized Updates:** Easier to patch bugs, update models, or change processing logic in one place.
- **Security/Compliance:** Audio files don’t need to be stored or processed long-term on client machines.
- **Audit & Logging:** Centralized logging, easier to track processing for compliance.

### **Potential Cons / Core Architecture Impact**
- **Load on Server:** If many clients upload audio simultaneously, the server could become a bottleneck (especially if transcription is CPU/GPU intensive).
    - This can be mitigated by queueing jobs (e.g., using a message broker or a lightweight job queue).
- **Network Bandwidth:** Audio files are larger than text, so ensure your network and storage are sized for expected volume.
- **Scaling:** Plan for horizontal scaling (multiple transcription workers) if you expect high throughput.

### **Best Practice**
- **Start centralized:** Send audio from Windows clients to the server for transcription. Monitor server load and performance.
- **Add a queue:** If transcription jobs pile up, use a queuing system (e.g., Redis Queue, Celery, or even simple file-based queues) to smooth out spikes.
- **Scale workers:** If needed, run multiple transcription workers (possibly as Docker containers) to handle more load.
- **Fallback:** If the server ever becomes a bottleneck, consider client-side fallback for low-priority or offline use, but this is rarely needed early on.

### **Summary Table**

| Approach                | Pros                              | Cons/Potential Risk       |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Server-side transcription | Stronger models, easier updates, secure | Server load, bandwidth   |
| Client-side transcription | Offloads server, works offline      | Weaker models, hard to manage, security risk|

**In almost all cases, server-side transcription is recommended for your use case—just monitor load and add queuing/scaling as you grow.**

If you’d like, I can suggest a basic flow or architecture for queuing and processing server-side transcriptions!
