Here’s a **sample Python script** to generate synthetic (simulated) data covering all fields you define. This can be placed in your **dev repo** (e.g., as `scripts/generate_fake_data.py`) and easily extended as your schema grows. This approach is often preferred over a self-hosted service for early development, but I’ll also mention a couple of open-source services at the end.

## **Sample Python Script: `generate_fake_data.py`**

```python
import random
import uuid
import json
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

def random_date(start, end):
    return start + timedelta(days=random.randint(0, int((end - start).days)))

def generate_patient():
    return {
        "id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "first_name": random.choice(["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David"]),
        "last_name": random.choice(["Smith", "Johnson", "Lee", "Zhang"]),
        "dob": random_date(datetime(1940, 1, 1), datetime(2020, 1, 1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "phone": f"+1-555-{random.randint(1000,9999)}",
        "email": f"user{random.randint(1,999)}@example.com",
        "address": f"{random.randint(100,999)} Main St",
        "insurance": random.choice(["Aetna", "BlueCross", "None"]),
        "notes": random.choice(["N/A", "Allergic to penicillin", "Diabetic"])
    }

def generate_encounter(patient_id):
    return {
        "encounter_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "patient_id": patient_id,
        "date": random_date(datetime(2023, 1, 1), datetime(2025, 7, 1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "reason": random.choice(["Checkup", "Flu Symptoms", "Follow-up", "Vaccination"]),
        "doctor": random.choice(["Dr. Miller", "Dr. Tan", "Dr. Gupta"]),
        "notes": random.choice(["All good", "Prescribed medication", "Needs follow-up"])
    }

def generate_lab_result(patient_id):
    return {
        "result_id": str(uuid.uuid4()),
        "patient_id": patient_id,
        "test": random.choice(["CBC", "A1C", "Lipid Panel", "COVID PCR"]),
        "date": random_date(datetime(2023, 1, 1), datetime(2025, 7, 1)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d"),
        "result": random.choice(["Normal", "Abnormal", "Pending"]),
        "value": round(random.uniform(1.0, 15.0), 2),
        "unit": random.choice(["mg/dL", "g/dL", "IU/L"])
    }

def main():
    patients = [generate_patient() for _ in range(10)]
    encounters = [generate_encounter(p["id"]) for p in patients for _ in range(random.randint(1, 3))]
    labs = [generate_lab_result(p["id"]) for p in patients for _ in range(random.randint(1, 2))]

    with open("sample_patients.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(patients, f, indent=2)
    with open("sample_encounters.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(encounters, f, indent=2)
    with open("sample_labs.json", "w") as f:
        json.dump(labs, f, indent=2)

    print("Generated sample_patients.json, sample_encounters.json, sample_labs.json")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

**How to use:**
1. Place the script in your dev repo (e.g., `scripts/generate_fake_data.py`).
2. Run:  
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/generate_fake_data.py
   ```
3. It will output three JSON files with complete, realistic sample data for patients, encounters, and labs.

## **Self-Hosted Services (Optional)**
If you want a web UI or more complex data:
- **Mockaroo** ([mockaroo.com](https://mockaroo.com/)): Free online, but also offers a self-hosted edition.
- **Faker.js** or **Faker (Python)**: Library for more advanced, customizable fake data generation.
- **OpenMRS Demo Data**: If you’re working with FHIR/medical data, look at OpenMRS synthetic datasets.
- **Synthea**: Generates realistic synthetic health records (FHIR, CSV, JSON). More complex, but highly detailed.

---

## **Summary**
- For most projects, a flexible Python script like above (in your dev repo) is fastest and most maintainable early on.
- You can expand schemas/fields as needed, and always regenerate fresh data.
- Use self-hosted services later if you need a UI or much more complex data relationships.

Let me know if you want this script tailored to your actual schema, or if you’d like pointers to use a specific generator like Synthea or Mockaroo!
