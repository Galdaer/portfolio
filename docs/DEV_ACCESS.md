### **Best Way to Do Development**

**1. Centralize Dev on Your Mini PC + GPU**
- Do all heavy-duty development (coding, building, running Whisper, etc.) directly on your mini PC with the GPU—this ensures you can use your hardware acceleration and keep everything consistent.

**2. Remote Access Options for You (Coding Remotely)**

- **Remote Desktop** (for a full desktop environment):
  - **Windows:** Use RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) or Chrome Remote Desktop.
  - **Linux:** Use xrdp, NoMachine, or RustDesk for a GUI desktop; or even VNC (TigerVNC, RealVNC).
  - **Security:** Make sure your VPN is up before exposing any remote desktop port! Do **not** expose RDP/VNC to the open internet (even behind DuckDNS).

- **Remote Coding Only (not full desktop):**
  - **VS Code Remote SSH:** Install the VS Code server on your mini PC. From your laptop, use VS Code’s “Remote - SSH” extension to code directly on the mini PC, with all files and terminals local to the mini PC. This is fast, secure, and works through VPN.
  - **SSH with Tmux/Screen:** For terminal-based workflows, SSH in and use tmux or screen for persistent sessions.

**3. How to Connect (Your Setup)**

- **VPN First:**  
  Both you and your dad connect to the same VPN (WireGuard/Tailscale/ZeroTier).
- **Remote Desktop or VS Code:**  
  - You: After VPN is up, use your laptop to connect to `galdaer.duckdns.org` (which should route to your mini PC’s internal VPN address), either with remote desktop or VS Code Remote SSH.
  - Your Dad: Connect VPN, then just open a browser to `http://galdaer.duckdns.org:<port>` (where your web service, dashboard, or JupyterLab is running).

---

**4. Port Forwarding & Access**
- **On VPN, both you and your dad are “local”** to the mini PC and can use LAN addresses or DuckDNS.
- **Browser apps (Jupyter, admin dashboards):**  
  Both of you can access them at the same address/port (via VPN).

---

**5. Security Notes**
- Always require VPN to access your dev machine—never open SSH, RDP, or VNC to the public internet.
- Use strong passwords and keys.
- Regularly update and monitor your mini PC for security.

### **Summary Table**

| User    | How They Connect                | What They Use              | Address/Port           |
|---------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| You     | VPN → Remote Desktop or VS Code | Full desktop or code-only  | `galdaer.duckdns.org`  |
| Dad     | VPN → Browser                   | Web dashboard/apps         | `galdaer.duckdns.org:<port>` |

**Recommended:**  
- Use VS Code Remote SSH for coding (best dev experience).
- Use xrdp or NoMachine for a full remote desktop if needed.
- Both you and your dad: Always connect VPN first, then use DuckDNS name.
