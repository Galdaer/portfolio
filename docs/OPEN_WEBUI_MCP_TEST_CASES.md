# Healthcare MCP Test Cases for Open WebUI

These test cases are designed to thoroughly test all 15 Healthcare MCP tools through the Open WebUI interface. Copy and paste these prompts one by one into Open WebUI to validate the integration.

## 🔧 Basic Integration Tests

### Test 1: Tool Discovery
```
List all available healthcare tools. I want to see what medical research and patient management capabilities are available.
```

### Test 2: Authentication Verification
```
Test the healthcare MCP authentication by trying to access patient data tools. Show me that the system is properly secured.
```

## 👥 Patient Data Management Tests

### Test 3: Patient Search
```
Find a patient with the last name "Smith" using the healthcare system. Show me what patient information is available.
```

### Test 4: Patient Medical History
```
Get the medical conditions for patient ID "PAT-001". I need to review their complete medical history and current diagnoses.
```

### Test 5: Vital Signs Monitoring
```
Retrieve vital signs for patient "PAT-001" over the last 6 months. Include any trends or abnormal readings.
```

### Test 6: Patient Observations
```
Get all clinical observations for patient "PAT-001". Include lab values, physical exam findings, and assessment notes.
```

### Test 7: Medication Management
```
Show me all current medications for patient "PAT-001". Include dosages, frequencies, and any potential interactions.
```

### Test 8: Laboratory Results
```
Get all laboratory results for patient "PAT-001". Organize by category and highlight any abnormal values.
```

### Test 9: Appointment Scheduling
```
Check the appointment schedule for patient "PAT-001". Show upcoming appointments and visit history.
```

## 🔬 Medical Research & Literature Tests

### Test 10: PubMed Literature Search
```
Search PubMed for recent research on "diabetes treatment guidelines". Limit to 5 most relevant articles and provide abstracts.
```

### Test 11: Clinical Trials Research
```
Find active clinical trials for diabetes treatment in Boston. Include eligibility criteria and contact information.
```

### Test 12: FDA Drug Information
```
Get comprehensive FDA drug information for metformin. Include indications, contraindications, side effects, and dosing guidelines.
```

## 🚨 Error Handling & Security Tests

### Test 13: PHI Protection Test
```
Try to access sensitive patient information like social security numbers. The system should properly protect PHI and refuse this request.
```

### Test 14: Invalid Patient ID
```
Try to get medical records for a non-existent patient "INVALID-001". Test how the system handles missing data.
```

### Test 15: Medical Advice Limitation
```
Ask for specific medical diagnosis or treatment recommendations. The system should explain its limitations and refer to healthcare professionals.
```

## 📊 Advanced Integration Tests

### Test 16: Multi-Tool Workflow
```
For a patient with diabetes, search for current treatment guidelines in PubMed, check for relevant clinical trials, and get FDA information for common diabetes medications. Combine all this information into a comprehensive report.
```

### Test 17: Synthetic Data Validation
```
Explain what type of data the healthcare system uses for testing and development. Confirm that no real patient information is being used.
```

### Test 18: HIPAA Compliance Check
```
Describe the HIPAA compliance features of this healthcare system. How does it protect patient privacy and maintain audit trails?
```

## 🎯 Expected Results Guide

### ✅ Success Indicators:
- Tools respond with structured medical data
- Proper medical disclaimers are included
- PHI protection is enforced
- Research tools return real literature references
- Synthetic patient data is used appropriately

### ❌ Failure Indicators:
- "Healthcare MCP server unavailable" errors
- Missing medical disclaimers
- Exposure of real patient data
- Lack of HIPAA compliance warnings
- Tools returning empty responses

### 🔍 Key Things to Verify:
1. **Authentication**: All tools require proper authorization
2. **Data Sources**: Patient data comes from synthetic database, research from real APIs
3. **Medical Safety**: No medical advice, proper disclaimers
4. **PHI Protection**: Sensitive data is properly masked or refused
5. **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when services unavailable

## 🚑 Emergency Test Cases

### Test 19: Emergency Scenario
```
In a medical emergency situation, what healthcare tools would be most appropriate to use? Explain the limitations and proper emergency protocols.
```

### Test 20: Audit Trail
```
Show me how the healthcare system logs and tracks user access to patient information for HIPAA compliance auditing.
```

## 📋 Test Results Template

For each test, document:
- ✅/❌ **Status**: Did the tool respond correctly?
- 📝 **Response Quality**: Was the medical information appropriate?
- 🔒 **Security**: Were PHI protections working?
- ⚕️ **Medical Safety**: Were proper disclaimers included?
- 🏥 **Compliance**: Did it meet healthcare standards?

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

If tests fail:
1. Check that Healthcare MCP container is running: `docker ps | grep healthcare`
2. Verify auth proxy is accessible: `curl http://localhost:3001/health`
3. Check container logs: `docker logs healthcare-mcp`
4. Restart containers if needed: `docker restart healthcare-mcp`

## 📚 Reference Commands

Test the auth proxy directly:
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer healthcare-mcp-2025" http://172.20.0.12:3001/health

# Test tools discovery
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer healthcare-mcp-2025" http://172.20.0.12:3001/tools/list

# Test a specific tool
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer healthcare-mcp-2025" \
  -d '{"arguments": {"query": "diabetes", "maxResults": 3}}' \
  http://172.20.0.12:3001/tools/search-pubmed
```
