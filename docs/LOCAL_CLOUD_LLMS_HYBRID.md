This is a very relevant architectural question for modern AI deployments in healthcare, clinics, and similar privacy-sensitive environments. Here’s a breakdown based on current best practices and technical realities (mid-2024):

---

## 1. **Cloud AI for Non-Sensitive Data: Why/When?**
- **Why clients want it:**
  - Cloud AI (OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, etc.) offers the most cutting-edge models—often more accurate, nuanced, and feature-rich.
  - Zero local infrastructure/maintenance needed.
  - Rapid access to updates and new capabilities.
- **When it makes sense:**
  - Data is **truly non-sensitive** (no PHI, no identifiers, no business secrets).
  - Use cases: Anonymized statistics, aggregate analytics, population health trends, non-patient-facing generative tasks, etc.

---

## 2. **Self-Hosted Models: How Close Can They Get?**
- **With enough hardware and budget** (modern GPUs, fast storage):
  - Open-source models (Whisper large, Llama-3, Mixtral, Stable Diffusion, etc.) can now approach or even match the **baseline performance** of cloud models for many tasks.
  - **Customization:** Self-hosted models can be fine-tuned on your own data, giving you targeted accuracy for your domain.
  - **Privacy & Compliance:** All data stays local; you have full control and auditability.
- **Limits:**
  - Leading cloud models are still ahead on frontier tasks (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Claude 3 Opus for some reasoning, multimodal, or context size).
  - Self-hosting means you manage scaling, reliability, updates.

---

## 3. **Hybrid Best Practice (What You Described)**
- **Primary:** Self-hosted models for all sensitive data/tasks.
- **Cloud AI:** For non-sensitive, non-regulatory use cases, or when you need the absolute best (and it’s legally/compliantly allowed).
- **Fallback:** Cloud only for non-sensitive, and local models as fallback for time-sensitive tasks if Internet is down.

**This hybrid is increasingly common:**
- Sensitive data: Self-hosted only.
- Non-sensitive data: Cloud or self-hosted, based on cost, speed, and desired quality.
- Emergency/Offline: Local models for critical tasks even if not best quality.

---

## 4. **What Most Clients Want (in 2024)**
- **Healthcare/Legal/Finance:** Self-hosted for anything sensitive. May use cloud for research, stats, or marketing.
- **SMBs/Non-profits:** Often use cloud for everything unless strictly regulated.
- **Tech-savvy orgs:** Hybrid—best of both, with clear routing rules and audit trails.

## 5. **Summary Table**

| Scenario                | Cloud AI         | Self-hosted AI   |
|-------------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Non-sensitive data      | Preferred (best models, easy) | Good if cost/privacy desired |
| Sensitive data (PHI)    | Avoid (privacy risk) | Strongly preferred |
| Time-sensitive, offline | Only if Internet | Best/only option |
| Customization needed    | Sometimes (via cloud fine-tune) | Full control |
| Cost no object          | Best models      | Best privacy/compliance |

---

**In short:**  
- Your hybrid approach is exactly what most privacy-sensitive clients want now.
- Self-hosted AI can be very close to cloud, given enough hardware and setup time.
- Cloud is still best for cutting-edge, but only for non-sensitive or anonymized data.
- Local fallback is a smart resilience strategy.
