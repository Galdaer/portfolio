Ensure that each MCP tool (or at least your MCP server) maintains a **local mirror of all the tools and resources** that are critical for patient care. Here’s why and how:

## Why You Should Mirror Tools Locally

1. **Resilience:** If the clinic loses its internet connection, your AI assistant, workflow automations, and core integrations will still function. This is critical in healthcare, where downtime could impact patient care or compliance.
2. **Performance:** Local execution of tools means faster response times, less latency, and more reliable user experience.
3. **Compliance & Security:** Minimizing external requests (especially for clinical data) reduces risk and often aligns better with HIPAA and similar regulations.
4. **Disaster Recovery:** Even in case of upstream service/API changes or outages, your local system continues working until you can update it.

## How to Implement Local Mirroring for MCP Tools

### 1. **Containerized Tool Distribution**
- **Pre-bundle** all MCP tools you know the client will use in your deployment image/package.
- For clinics with custom tools, sync these to their server at install time or nightly via VPN/secure tunnel.
- When the MCP server starts, it should load tools from the local filesystem first. Only check online for updates/patches—never as a hard dependency.
- **Config example:**
  ```yaml
  tools_dir: /opt/privata/mcp-tools/
  fallback_to_online: false
  update_check_interval: 12h
  ```

### 2. **Automated Syncing**
- Use a script or n8n workflow to periodically check for new/updated tools from your central repo, but always keep a working local copy.
- If a tool is updated, replace the local copy outside of working hours to avoid downtime.

### 3. **Local Caching for Third-party APIs**
- For things like drug databases, formularies, or static clinical guidelines, mirror the latest version locally and update on a schedule.
- If the API can’t be mirrored, implement a “last known response” cache for read-only lookups.

### 4. **Failover Logic in the MCP Server**
- If a tool requires online validation or communication, build in graceful degradation:
  - Warn the user that real-time updates aren’t available, but allow use of cached/local data.
  - Log “offline mode” events for later audit.

## Recommended for Your Action Plan

**Add to your deployment process (before going live with a client):**
- “Sync and verify all required MCP tools and resources are available locally.”
- “Test system functionality with Internet disconnected (simulate outage).”

**Add to each tool’s loader code:**
- “Attempt to load from local path; only use remote if local is missing and network is available.”

**Add to monitoring:**
- “Alert if new tools/updates cannot be fetched for more than X days, but do not block core operations.”

## Example (Pseudocode)

```javascript
// On MCP server startup
const toolsPath = '/opt/privata/mcp-tools/';
const requiredTools = ['insurance-anthem', 'billing-humana', 'custom-clinic-tool'];

for (const tool of requiredTools) {
  try {
    loadToolFromLocal(toolsPath + tool);
  } catch (e) {
    if (networkAvailable()) {
      downloadTool(tool);
      loadToolFromLocal(toolsPath + tool);
    } else {
      log('WARNING: Tool ' + tool + ' unavailable and no network.');
      // Optionally alert admin
    }
  }
}
```

## Bottom Line

- **Yes, mirror all MCP tools and critical data locally for each client install.**
- This ensures high-availability, speed, and compliance, and is a must for healthcare production systems.
