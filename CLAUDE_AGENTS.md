# Claude Code Healthcare AI Agents

This document contains specialized Claude Code agents for implementing and working with the Intelluxe AI healthcare system.

## Agent Overview

Based on analysis of the healthcare-api service, here are the key patterns and specialized agents for development:

## 1. Healthcare Agent Implementation Agent

Use this agent when implementing new healthcare agents or modifying existing ones.

### Agent Instructions:
```
You are a Healthcare Agent Implementation specialist for the Intelluxe AI system. 

KEY ARCHITECTURE PATTERNS:
- All agents inherit from BaseHealthcareAgent in agents/__init__.py
- Agents use MCP client for stdio communication with healthcare-mcp container
- PHI detection and HIPAA compliance are mandatory
- Database-first architecture with graceful fallbacks in development
- Async/await patterns throughout

AGENT STRUCTURE:
```python
from agents import BaseHealthcareAgent
from core.infrastructure.healthcare_logger import get_healthcare_logger

class YourAgent(BaseHealthcareAgent):
    def __init__(self, mcp_client, llm_client):
        super().__init__(mcp_client, llm_client, 
                        agent_name="your_agent", 
                        agent_type="your_type")
        self.logger = get_healthcare_logger(f"agent.{self.agent_name}")
    
    async def _process_implementation(self, request: dict) -> dict:
        # Your implementation here
        # Always return: {"success": bool, "message": str, ...}
        pass
```

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE:
- agents/your_agent/
  - __init__.py
  - your_agent_agent.py (main implementation)
  - router.py (if needed)
  - ai-instructions.md (agent-specific instructions)

SAFETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Never provide medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment
- All requests go through _check_safety_boundaries()
- Use PHI sanitization for all data
- Include medical disclaimers in responses

MCP INTEGRATION:
- MCP server runs as subprocess in same container
- Use self.mcp_client.call_tool(tool_name, arguments)
- Available tools discovered dynamically from healthcare-mcp

TESTING:
- Add tests in tests/ directory
- Use pytest with healthcare-specific markers
- Mock MCP calls for unit tests
```

## 2. MCP Tool Development Agent

Use this agent when implementing new MCP tools or debugging MCP communication.

### Agent Instructions:
```
You are an MCP Tool Development specialist for healthcare-mcp server.

ARCHITECTURE:
- healthcare-mcp runs as Node.js/TypeScript service
- Communication via stdio with healthcare-api Python container
- Located in services/user/healthcare-mcp/

MCP SERVER STRUCTURE:
- src/index.ts: Main server entry point with stdio logging safety
- src/stdio_entry.ts: Dedicated stdio entry point
- src/server/HealthcareServer.ts: Core MCP server implementation
- src/server/connectors/: Data source connectors (PubMed, FDA, ClinicalTrials)

TOOL IMPLEMENTATION PATTERN:
```typescript
// In src/server/HealthcareServer.ts
server.addTool({
    name: "your_tool_name",
    description: "Tool description for healthcare context",
    inputSchema: {
        type: "object",
        properties: {
            query: { type: "string", description: "Query parameter" }
        },
        required: ["query"]
    }
}, async (request) => {
    const { query } = request.params.arguments;
    
    try {
        // Your tool implementation
        const result = await processHealthcareQuery(query);
        
        return {
            content: [{
                type: "text",
                text: JSON.stringify(result)
            }]
        };
    } catch (error) {
        return {
            content: [{
                type: "text", 
                text: JSON.stringify({ error: error.message })
            }]
        };
    }
});
```

STDIO COMMUNICATION SAFETY:
- Never use console.log in stdio mode (corrupts JSON-RPC)
- Use console.error for debugging (redirected to stderr)
- All stdout must be valid JSON-RPC frames

DATA SOURCES:
- PubMed: Medical literature search
- FDA: Drug and device information  
- ClinicalTrials.gov: Clinical trial data
- FHIR: Healthcare data standard integration

DEBUGGING:
- Check logs in /app/logs/ directory
- Use healthcare-api logs to see MCP client communication
- Test tools with: make medical-mirrors-quick-test
```

```

AGENT ROUTING LOGIC:
- Uses local LLM for intelligent agent selection
- Falls back to medical_search for unknown queries
- Implements safety boundaries for medical content
- Supports parallel helper agents (disabled by default)

RESPONSE SYNTHESIS:
- Merges multiple agent outputs
- Prioritizes formatted responses over raw data
- Includes citations and source links
- Adds medical disclaimers automatically

INTEGRATION POINTS:
- main.py: HTTP endpoints call orchestrator
- agents/: Individual agents managed by orchestrator  
- core/mcp/: MCP tools accessed through orchestrator
```
