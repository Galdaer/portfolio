**Repository:** intelluxe-core (branch: copilot/fix-222f6002-c434-456d-8224-50f652dcf487)

## 🎯 MISSION: Complete Medical Search Agent Implementation + Real-Time Medical Literature Search

## ✅ MAJOR BREAKTHROUGHS ACHIEVED (Don't Break These!)

### 1. **CRITICAL: MCP Async Task Management Bug FIXED**
- **Problem:** CPU drain from runaway async tasks causing system performance degradation
- **Root Cause:** MCP STDIO client creating unclosed context managers, accumulating background tasks
- **Solution Applied:** Added explicit MCP cleanup in all agent `finally` blocks
- **Files Fixed:** 
  - `/home/intelluxe/services/user/healthcare-api/core/mcp/healthcare_mcp_client.py` - Fixed async lifecycle
  - `/home/intelluxe/services/user/healthcare-api/agents/medical_search_agent/medical_search_agent.py` - Added cleanup
  - `/home/intelluxe/services/user/healthcare-api/agents/intake/intake_agent.py` - Added cleanup
- **Result:** No more `Task exception was never retrieved` errors, CPU performance restored

### 2. **SciSpacy Model Successfully Upgraded - WORKING**
- **Upgrade:** BC5CDR (2 entity types) → BIONLP13CG (16 comprehensive entity types)
- **New Entity Types:** AMINO_ACID, ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM, CANCER, CELL, CELLULAR_COMPONENT, DEVELOPING_ANATOMICAL_STRUCTURE, GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT, IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY, MULTI-TISSUE_STRUCTURE, ORGAN, ORGANISM, ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION, ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE, PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION, SIMPLE_CHEMICAL, TISSUE
- **Testing Confirmed:** Model detects "ORGANISM", "ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM", "TISSUE", "ORGAN" in medical text
- **Container:** Successfully downloading and loading en_ner_bionlp13cg_md model
- **Files Updated:** `/home/intelluxe/services/user/scispacy/app/scispacy_server.py`, entrypoint.sh

### 3. **Real-Time Logging System - FIXED AND WORKING**
- **Problem:** Logs only appeared on shutdown, not real-time
- **Solution:** Healthcare logging infrastructure properly configured
- **Result:** Medical search operations, entity detection, and agent processing now log in real-time
- **Verification:** Live logging visible during API calls, not just container shutdown

### 4. **LLM Agent Selection - OPTIMIZED** 
- **Problem:** LLM returning verbose explanations instead of agent names
- **Solution:** Ollama structured output with JSON schema in `main.py:select_agent_with_llm()`
- **Result:** LLM correctly selects agents (e.g., "medical_search") without verbose text
- **Performance:** Clean agent routing working efficiently

### 5. **Agent Architecture - STABLE**
- 8 agents loading successfully via dynamic discovery
- Constructor signatures fixed for dependency injection
- FastAPI HTTP server with clean stdio separation
- Healthcare services initialization working properly

## ❌ WHAT STILL NEEDS IMPLEMENTATION (Critical Priority!)

### 1. **Medical Search Agent Implementation - INCOMPLETE BUT FOUNDATION READY**

**Current State:** Agent loads successfully but returns empty results
```json
{
  "information_sources": [],
  "search_confidence": 0.0
}
```

**Root Cause Analysis:** Method implementations are incomplete/stubbed
**File:** `/home/intelluxe/services/user/healthcare-api/agents/medical_search_agent/medical_search_agent.py`

**Specific Implementation Gaps:**
- `_process_implementation()` method partially implemented (lines 47-100+)
- `_search_condition_information()` - Needs MCP-based medical database search
- `_search_clinical_references()` - Needs medical literature API integration  
- `_search_drug_information()` - Needs pharmaceutical database connection
- `_determine_evidence_level()` - Needs medical literature quality assessment
- `_rank_sources_by_evidence()` - Needs source credibility scoring

**Architecture Requirements:**
- **MCP-FIRST APPROACH**: All medical content via MCP tools from authoritative sources
- **NO HARDCODED MEDICAL DATA**: Liability risk - we are not medical professionals
- **FAIL FAST**: Clear errors when MCP medical sources unavailable
- **LLM for TEXT PROCESSING ONLY**: Query parsing, formatting - never medical content generation

### 2. **Response Formatting - INFRASTRUCTURE READY, CLIENT NEEDS VERIFICATION**
**Status:** Server-side formatting implemented, client integration unknown
- `format_response_for_user()` function working
- `ProcessRequest.format` parameter (human/json) implemented
- `ProcessResponse.formatted_response` field populated
- **Need to verify:** Client using `formatted_response` field correctly

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FOUNDATION (All Working)

### **Service Architecture:**
- **Database:** PostgreSQL + Redis with synthetic healthcare data
- **MCP Client:** `/home/intelluxe/services/user/healthcare-api/core/mcp/healthcare_mcp_client.py` (async lifecycle fixed)
- **LLM Client:** Ollama AsyncClient via `healthcare_services.llm_client`
- **SciSpacy:** Upgraded BIONLP13CG model with 16 entity types
- **Real-time Logging:** Working healthcare event logging
- **Agent Discovery:** Dynamic discovery loading 8 agents successfully

### **Critical Code Patterns Established:**

```python
# ✅ WORKING: MCP-first medical search with proper cleanup
async def _process_implementation(self, request: dict[str, Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
    if not self.mcp_client:
        return {
            "success": False,
            "error": "Medical search unavailable - no MCP connection to authoritative medical sources",
            "disclaimers": self.disclaimers
        }
    try:
        # MCP-based medical search implementation needed here
        query = request.get("message", "")
        results = await self._search_medical_literature(query)
        return {"success": True, "results": results}
    except Exception as e:
        logger.exception(f"Search processing error: {e}")
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
    finally:
        # CRITICAL: MCP cleanup to prevent runaway tasks
        try:
            if hasattr(self.mcp_client, 'disconnect'):
                await self.mcp_client.disconnect()
                logger.debug("MCP client disconnected after search")
        except Exception as cleanup_error:
            logger.warning(f"Error during MCP cleanup: {cleanup_error}")

# ✅ WORKING: Enhanced entity detection with BIONLP13CG
medical_entity_types = {
    "AMINO_ACID", "ANATOMICAL_SYSTEM", "CANCER", "CELL", 
    "CELLULAR_COMPONENT", "DEVELOPING_ANATOMICAL_STRUCTURE",
    "GENE_OR_GENE_PRODUCT", "IMMATERIAL_ANATOMICAL_ENTITY",
    "MULTI-TISSUE_STRUCTURE", "ORGAN", "ORGANISM", 
    "ORGANISM_SUBDIVISION", "ORGANISM_SUBSTANCE",
    "PATHOLOGICAL_FORMATION", "SIMPLE_CHEMICAL", "TISSUE"
}
```

## 🚀 IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN

### **Priority 1: Complete Medical Search Agent Implementation**

**Goal:** Return populated medical literature search results from authoritative sources

**Critical Implementation Tasks:**

1. **Complete `_process_implementation()` method:**
   ```python
   # Extract search query from request
   # Validate MCP connection (fail fast if unavailable)  
   # Call medical literature search methods
   # Format comprehensive response with evidence levels
   # Include proper medical disclaimers
   ```

2. **Implement core search methods with MCP-ONLY approach:**
   - `_search_condition_information()` - Connect to medical databases via MCP
   - `_search_clinical_references()` - PubMed/medical literature APIs via MCP
   - `_search_drug_information()` - Pharmaceutical databases via MCP
   - `_determine_evidence_level()` - Medical literature quality assessment
   - `_rank_sources_by_evidence()` - Source credibility and relevance scoring

3. **Medical Knowledge Sourcing Rules (CRITICAL LIABILITY PROTECTION):**
   - **NO HARDCODED MEDICAL FACTS** - Creates liability and accuracy risks
   - **MCP TOOLS ONLY** - All medical content from authoritative external databases
   - **FAIL GRACEFULLY** - Clear error messages when medical sources unavailable
   - **LLM FOR TEXT ONLY** - Query parsing, result formatting, never medical content

4. **Complete utility methods:**
   - `_extract_medical_concepts()` - Use upgraded SciSpacy BIONLP13CG model
   - `_format_search_response()` - Human-readable medical literature summaries
   - `_validate_medical_query()` - Query safety and appropriateness checks

### **Priority 2: End-to-End Validation**

**Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Test medical search with human-readable formatting
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Find recent research on cardiovascular health", "format": "human"}'

# Test entity detection with upgraded model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/process \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "analyze cardiac tissue inflammation", "format": "json"}'
```

**Verification Checklist:**
