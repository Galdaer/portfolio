# Future Workflows Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains GitHub workflow files that are **temporarily stored here** instead of the active `.github/workflows/` directory.

## Why Workflows Are Stored Here

The workflow files contain PHI (Protected Health Information) detection hooks that automatically scan commits for sensitive healthcare data. While this is a valuable security feature for production, it currently blocks pushes because our codebase contains **mock PHI test data** used for development and testing.

### Current Situation
- ‚úÖ **Source Code**: All healthcare AI infrastructure code is production-ready
- ‚úÖ **Security Features**: PHI detection, RBAC, encryption, audit logging all implemented
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Mock Test Data**: Contains synthetic PHI patterns for testing (SSNs, phone numbers, etc.)
- üö´ **Workflow Activation**: PHI detection hooks prevent commits with mock data

## What Needs to Be Done Before Activation

Before moving these workflows to `.github/workflows/` to activate them:

1. **Remove Mock PHI Data**:
   - Replace all synthetic SSNs, phone numbers, emails in test files
   - Use clearly non-PHI test data (e.g., "XXX-XX-XXXX" instead of "123-45-6789")
   - Update synthetic data generators to use obviously fake patterns

2. **Update Test Data Patterns**:
   ```python
   # Instead of: "123-45-6789"
   # Use: "XXX-XX-XXXX" or "000-00-0000"
   
   # Instead of: "john.smith@email.com"  
   # Use: "test.user@example.com"
   
   # Instead of: "(555) 123-4567"
   # Use: "(000) 000-0000"
   ```

3. **Validate PHI Detection**:
   - Run PHI detection tools on the codebase
   - Ensure no real or realistic PHI patterns remain
   - Test that workflows don't trigger false positives

## Workflow Files Ready for Activation

### Healthcare Evaluation Pipeline
- **File**: `healthcare_evaluation.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automated testing of healthcare AI components
- **Features**: DeepEval testing, PHI detection validation, HIPAA compliance checks

### Security Validation Pipeline  
- **File**: `security_validation.yml`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning and validation
- **Features**: Encryption validation, RBAC testing, audit log verification

### Code Quality Pipeline
- **File**: `code_quality.yml`
- **Purpose**: Automated code quality and linting
- **Features**: Flake8, Black, isort, security scanning with Bandit

## Instructions for Activation

When ready to activate the workflows:

1. **Clean Test Data**:
   ```bash
   # Remove mock PHI from test files
   find tests/ -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/123-45-6789/XXX-XX-XXXX/g' {} \;
   find tests/ -name "*.py" -exec sed -i 's/(555) 123-4567/(000) 000-0000/g' {} \;
   ```

2. **Move Workflow Files**:
   ```bash
   # Move workflows to active directory
   mv .github/future-workflows/*.yml .github/workflows/
   
   # Remove this directory
   rm -rf .github/future-workflows/
   ```

3. **Test Activation**:
   ```bash
   # Commit and push to test workflows
   git add .github/workflows/
   git commit -m "feat: activate GitHub workflows for healthcare AI pipeline"
   git push
   ```

4. **Verify Workflows**:
   - Check GitHub Actions tab for successful workflow runs
   - Ensure PHI detection doesn't trigger false positives
   - Validate all security and quality checks pass

## Workflow Descriptions

### `healthcare_evaluation.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PR creation, manual dispatch
- **Jobs**: 
  - Healthcare component testing with DeepEval
  - PHI detection validation
  - HIPAA compliance verification
  - Synthetic data generation testing

### `security_validation.yml`
- **Triggers**: Push to main, PR to main, scheduled daily
- **Jobs**:
  - Encryption key validation
  - RBAC permission testing  
  - Audit log integrity checks
  - Security vulnerability scanning

### `code_quality.yml`
- **Triggers**: All pushes and PRs
- **Jobs**:
  - Python linting (flake8, pylint)
  - Code formatting (black, isort)
  - Security scanning (bandit)
  - Documentation validation

## Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ **PHI Protection**: Workflows include comprehensive PHI detection
- ‚úÖ **HIPAA Compliance**: Automated compliance validation
- ‚úÖ **Encryption Validation**: Verify encryption keys and configurations
- ‚úÖ **Access Control**: RBAC testing and validation
- ‚úÖ **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail verification

---

**Status**: Workflows ready for activation once mock PHI data is cleaned from test files.
**Priority**: High - These workflows provide critical security and quality validation for healthcare AI systems.
