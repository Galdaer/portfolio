        "Are ICD-10/CPT codes formatted correctly?"
    ],
    "soap_notes": [
        "Does SOAP processing maintain proper structure?",
        "Is there clear separation between sections?",
        "Are assessment vs diagnosis terms used correctly?"
    ],
    "clinical_workflows": [
        "Does the workflow follow clinical best practices?",
        "Are care transitions handled properly?",
        "Is provider handoff information preserved?"
    ]
}
```

### 2. Compliance & Security Review

```python
# ‚úÖ REVIEW CHECKLIST: Healthcare compliance
compliance_checklist = {
    "hipaa_compliance": [
        "Is PHI properly encrypted at rest and in transit?",
        "Are access controls implemented for all PHI access?",
        "Is audit logging comprehensive and tamper-proof?"
    ],
    "medical_safety": [
        "Does code avoid making medical recommendations?",
        "Are medical disclaimers present where needed?",
        "Is there clear escalation to healthcare professionals?"
    ],
    "data_handling": [
        "Is data minimization principle followed?",
        "Are retention policies implemented correctly?",
        "Is cross-border data transfer compliant?"
    ]
}
```

### 3. Integration & Interoperability

```python
# ‚úÖ REVIEW CHECKLIST: Healthcare integration
integration_checklist = {
    "ehr_integration": [
        "Are HL7 FHIR standards followed correctly?",
        "Is error handling comprehensive for EHR failures?",
        "Are transaction logs audit-compliant?"
    ],
    "agent_communication": [
        "Is inter-agent communication secure?",
        "Are message formats consistent across agents?",
        "Is there proper timeout and retry logic?"
    ],
    "external_apis": [
        "Are healthcare API calls properly authenticated?",
        "Is rate limiting implemented for external services?",
        "Are API responses validated for medical correctness?"
    ]
}
```

## Review Process Workflow

### Pre-Review Setup

1. **Environment Check**: Ensure review environment has no access to production PHI
2. **Context Loading**: Review related healthcare compliance documentation
3. **Tool Preparation**: Set up Ruff, MyPy, and healthcare-specific linters

### Code Review Steps

```python
def healthcare_code_review_process(pull_request: PullRequest) -> ReviewResult:
    """Comprehensive healthcare code review process."""

    review_results = {
        "medical_safety": [],
        "phi_compliance": [],
        "technical_quality": [],
        "integration_patterns": []
    }

    for file_change in pull_request.changed_files:
        # Medical safety review
        review_results["medical_safety"].extend(
            review_medical_advice_prevention(file_change.content)
        )

        # PHI handling review
        review_results["phi_compliance"].extend(
            review_phi_handling(file_change.content)
        )

        # Technical quality review
        review_results["technical_quality"].extend(
            review_type_annotations(file_change.content)
        )

        # Healthcare integration review
        if "ehr" in file_change.path or "agent" in file_change.path:
            review_results["integration_patterns"].extend(
                review_ehr_integration(file_change.content)
            )

    return ReviewResult(review_results)
```

### Review Comments Templates

#### Medical Safety Issues

```markdown
**‚ö†Ô∏è Medical Safety Concern**

This code appears to provide medical advice/recommendations. In healthcare AI systems, we must:

- Focus on administrative and documentation support only
- Include medical disclaimers: "This system does not provide medical advice"
- Escalate medical decisions to qualified healthcare professionals

**Suggested Action**: Refactor to provide administrative support without medical interpretation.
```

#### PHI Protection Issues

```markdown
**üîí PHI Protection Required**

This code handles Protected Health Information (PHI) and needs additional safeguards:

- Encrypt PHI fields at rest and in transit
- Implement audit logging for all PHI access
- Use anonymized logging (patient hash instead of identifiers)
- Apply data minimization principles

**Suggested Action**: Implement PHI protection patterns from healthcare security guidelines.
```

#### Healthcare Integration Issues

```markdown
**üè• Healthcare Integration Pattern**

This integration with healthcare systems should follow established patterns:

- Use HL7 FHIR standards for data exchange
- Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
- Include audit logging for compliance requirements
- Validate all healthcare data formats

**Suggested Action**: Review healthcare integration documentation and apply standard patterns.
```

## Review Automation Integration

### GitHub Actions Integration

```yaml
# Add to healthcare-ai-validation.yml
- name: Healthcare Code Review Automation
  run: |
    echo "üè• Running automated healthcare code review..."

    # Check for medical advice patterns
    python3 scripts/healthcare-compliance-check.py --mode=review

    # Validate PHI handling
    python3 scripts/check-phi-exposure.py --review-mode

    # Run healthcare-specific linting
    ruff check --config=pyproject.toml --select=HC  # Healthcare-specific rules
```

### Modern Development Tools Integration

- **Ruff Integration**: `ruff check --select=E,W,F,HC` (with healthcare-specific rules)
- **MyPy Healthcare**: Custom mypy configuration for healthcare type checking
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Healthcare compliance validation in pre-commit pipeline
- **VS Code Integration**: Healthcare-specific snippets and linting rules
