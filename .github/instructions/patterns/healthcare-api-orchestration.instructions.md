# Healthcare API MCP Integration Patterns

## Strategic Purpose

**COMPREHENSIVE HEALTHCARE ROUTING**: Healthcare-api handles all routing, agent decisions, tool selection, and MCP integration while maintaining PHI protection and medical compliance.

**Architecture Role**: Receives requests from thin MCP pipeline and orchestrates complete healthcare AI workflows.

## Healthcare API Architecture Patterns

### Agent Orchestration Hub

```python
# ✅ PATTERN: Healthcare API as central orchestration hub
class HealthcareOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = {
            'intake': IntakeAgent(),
            'document_processor': DocumentProcessorAgent(),
            'research_assistant': ResearchAssistantAgent()
        }
        self.mcp_client = HealthcareMCPClient()
    
    async def route_request(self, request: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Route request to appropriate agent based on content analysis"""
        # Analyze request and select appropriate agent
        pass
    
    async def coordinate_agents(self, primary_agent: str, request: Dict[str, Any]) -> Any:
        """Coordinate multiple agents for complex workflows"""
        # Multi-agent coordination with MCP tool integration
        pass
```

### Agent-MCP Integration

```python
# ✅ PATTERN: Agent-driven MCP tool selection (builds on api-development.instructions.md)
class AgentMCPCoordination:
    async def agent_select_mcp_tools(self, agent_type: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[str]:
        """Let agents decide which MCP tools to use based on context"""
        # Agent-specific tool selection logic
        pass
    
    async def coordinate_agent_mcp_workflow(self, primary_agent: str, mcp_tools: List[str]) -> Any:
        """Coordinate agent workflow with selected MCP tools"""
        # Multi-step agent + MCP coordination
        pass
```

## Agent Coordination Patterns (Focus on Orchestration Hub Role)

### Agent Selection Logic

```python
# ✅ PATTERN: Intelligent agent selection based on request analysis
class AgentSelector:
    def analyze_request_intent(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        """Analyze user message to determine appropriate agent"""
        # Intent classification for agent selection
        pass
    
    def select_primary_agent(self, intent: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Select primary agent based on intent and context"""
        # Agent selection logic
        pass
```

## Database Integration Patterns

### Healthcare Data Access

```python
# ✅ PATTERN: Database-first healthcare data access
class HealthcareDataManager:
    async def get_patient_context(self, patient_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Get patient context from database with PHI protection"""
        # Database-first with synthetic fallbacks
        pass
    
    async def store_interaction(self, interaction_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Store healthcare interaction with audit logging"""
        # HIPAA-compliant interaction storage
        pass
```

### Session Management

```python
# ✅ PATTERN: Healthcare session management with Redis
class HealthcareSessionManager:
    async def create_session(self, user_id: str, role: str) -> str:
        """Create healthcare session with RBAC validation"""
        # Session creation with healthcare RBAC
        pass
    
    async def maintain_context(self, session_id: str, context: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Maintain conversation context across interactions"""
        # Context preservation with PHI protection
        pass
```

## Agent Workflow Orchestration (Non-Duplicative Focus)

### Multi-Agent Coordination

```python
# ✅ PATTERN: Multi-agent workflow coordination
class MultiAgentCoordinator:
    async def coordinate_sequential_agents(self, workflow: List[str], context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Run agents in sequence with context passing"""
        # Sequential agent execution with context preservation
        pass
    
    async def coordinate_parallel_agents(self, agents: List[str], context: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Run agents in parallel and merge results"""
        # Parallel agent execution with result merging
        pass
```
