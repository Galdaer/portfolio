## Real-World MCP & Ollama Integration Patterns

### Docker Networking

- Use a user-defined bridge network for multi-container setups:
  ```sh
  docker network create intelluxe-net
  docker run --network intelluxe-net --name ollama-container ... ollama-image
  docker run --network intelluxe-net --name mcp-container ... mcp-image
  ```
- Use container names as hostnames (e.g., `http://ollama-container:11434`) for internal API calls.

### Ollama API Integration

- Set `OLLAMA_API_URL` to the correct address for your environment:
  - Host: `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
  - Docker network: `http://ollama-container:11434`
- Only use `/mcp` endpoint with JSON-RPC payloads for MCP server requests.

### JSON-RPC Payload Example

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"method\": \"generate_documentation\", \"params\": {\"prompt\": \"Test prompt\"}, \"id\": 1}"
```

### Troubleshooting Patterns

- If you get "Unknown MCP method", ensure the handler is implemented in `index.ts`.
- For network issues, verify both containers are on the same Docker network.
- Install missing utilities in your dev container as needed:
  ```sh
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install iputils-ping
  ```

### Shell Script Robustness

- Avoid strict flags (`set -euo pipefail`) during debugging.
- Add `set -x` for verbose output.

### PHI Safety

- Always use synthetic data for development and testing.
- Include compliance disclaimers in all documentation and endpoint responses.

### RAG-Powered Development Patterns

#### Code Search and Analysis

```python
# Example: Use GitHub MCP to find similar implementations
# Search for existing PHI detection patterns
search_results = github_mcp.search_code("PHI detection healthcare")

# Use Pylance MCP to analyze imports and dependencies
import_analysis = pylance_mcp.analyze_imports(workspace_root)

# Use Sequential Thinking MCP for complex decisions
solution = sequential_thinking_mcp.solve_problem(
    "How to implement HIPAA-compliant real-time PHI detection"
)
```

#### Healthcare-Specific Development

```python
# Example: Healthcare MCP integration for medical features
# Check PHI compliance before processing
phi_result = healthcare_mcp.detect_phi(user_input)

# Validate healthcare configuration
compliance_check = healthcare_mcp.validate_hipaa_compliance(config)

# Generate synthetic medical data for testing
test_data = healthcare_mcp.generate_synthetic_healthcare_data(
    doctors=10, patients=100, encounters=200
)
```

#### Automated Code Quality

```python
# Example: Pylance MCP for code improvement
# Analyze and fix imports
import_fixes = pylance_mcp.fix_imports(file_path)

# Refactor code structure
refactored_code = pylance_mcp.refactor_code(
    file_path, refactor_type="extract_function"
)

# Validate syntax across workspace
syntax_errors = pylance_mcp.check_syntax_errors(workspace_root)
```
