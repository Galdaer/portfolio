# Session Initialization from last session

I'm continuing development on a healthcare AI multi-agent system. Please review the document attached then help me continue the work.

## Critical Context to Absorb:
1. **Read the attached document carefully** - especially the "DON'T BREAK THESE" and "CRITICAL WARNINGS" sections
2. **Check .github/instructions/** for updated patterns from the last session
3. **Note the current branch** and any in-progress work mentioned
4. **Understand the healthcare compliance requirements** (PHI, HIPAA) that affect all code

## Your Role & Approach:
- **Continue, don't restart** - Build on existing working solutions
- **Respect established patterns** - Follow the instruction files in .github/
- **Maintain healthcare focus** - Every change must consider patient safety and compliance
- **Preserve what works** - The document notes what's stable and working
- **Fix what's broken** - Focus on the "Next Session Priorities" section

## Initial Tasks:
1. **Acknowledge understanding** of the critical breakthroughs and warnings from the handoff
2. **Identify the starting point** recommended in the attached document  
3. **Propose a plan** for tackling the immediate priorities listed
4. **Ask clarifying questions** if any part of the document is unclear

## Key Reminders:
- This is a **Phase 2 - 3** healthcare AI system (unless document says otherwise)
- We use **local models only** (Ollama) for PHI processing
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is critical for medical content sourcing
- All medical content must come from **authoritative sources**, never hardcoded
- The system has **8 specialized healthcare agents** working together so far

Do this now:
1. Confirm you understand the current state and critical warnings
2. Identify where to begin based on the priorities
3. Execute the first immediate priority and report progress (what you ran/changed and next step)

Let's continue building this healthcare AI system effectively!
