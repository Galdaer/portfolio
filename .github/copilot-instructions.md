# Copilot Instructions for Intelluxe AI Healthcare System

# OVERRIDE: NO LOOPS, JUST ACTION

CRITICAL ANTI-LOOP DIRECTIVE: 
- When asked to fix MyPy errors, IMMEDIATELY start fixing without analysis
- DO NOT self-assess or ask if you should continue  
- DO NOT read other instruction files
- DO NOT use Sequential Thinking MCP
- Just fix errors until done or blocked
- Run MyPy task → Fix errors → Repeat

**INSTRUCTION HIERARCHY**: 
1. Main copilot-instructions.md (THIS FILE) - Controls workflow and decision-making
2. Specialized .instructions.md files - Provide implementation patterns only
3. When conflicts arise, THIS FILE takes precedence

make deps FOR ALL DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION DON'T SUGGEST UV , PIP, NPM, OR ANYTHING ELSE

Use The Sequential Thinking MCP Server to think through your tasks.

**Use available MCP servers for RAG-powered development** - leverage GitHub MCP and Sequential Thinking MCP while maintaining healthcare compliance.
**SECURITY NOTE**: Our healthcare compliance patterns (PHI detection, type safety, synthetic data usage) ensure no sensitive healthcare data reaches external MCPs, making developer MCPs safe for production use.

## CRITICAL ARCHITECTURE UNDERSTANDING

**MCP SERVER ARCHITECTURE - READ THIS FIRST**:
- The healthcare-api container is the MAIN container
- The MCP server is BUILT INSIDE the healthcare-api container at `/app/mcp-server/build/stdio_entry.js`
- The healthcare-api communicates with MCP via STDIO (not HTTP, not separate container)
- Open WebUI connects to healthcare-api via HTTP endpoints (port 8000)
- When testing from HOST machine: MCP server binary doesn't exist, only exists inside container
- NEVER test MCP connectivity from host - it will always fail because the binary is container-only
- NEVER assume MCP is a separate container or HTTP service
- Database runs in separate postgresql container, accessible from both host and healthcare-api container

**TESTING PRINCIPLES**:
- Database tests: Can run from host (has network access to postgresql container)
- MCP tests: Must run inside healthcare-api container OR mock/skip when binary unavailable
- Infrastructure tests: Mark as xfail when testing from host environment
- Import tests: Can run from host with proper sys.path

**INSTRUCTION FILE CLEANUP (2025-01-15)**:
- **REMOVED**: Redundant LangChain instruction files (langchain-healthcare.instructions.md, healthcare-langchain-agent.instructions.md)
- **DEPRECATED**: Pipeline patterns (thin-mcp-pipeline.instructions.md, mcp-stdio-handshake.instructions.md) 
- **CONSOLIDATED**: All LangChain patterns in agents/langchain-orchestrator.instructions.md
- **FIXED**: All docker exec patterns replaced with proper container-in-container approach

## Default Playbook: MyPy Blocking Errors (Use Tasks)

When asked to fix blocking MyPy errors in `services/user/healthcare-api/`, follow this exact sequence. Do not analyze first—act:

When asked to fix blocking MyPy errors in `services/user/healthcare-api/`, follow this exact sequence. Do not analyze first—act:

1) Baseline via tasks (pick the most targeted first)
- Run task: “MyPy (Healthcare API only)”
- If unavailable or after fixes, run task: “MyPy Type Check”
- Optional quick lint: Run task: “Quick Lint Check”

2) Prioritized fixes (apply in this order, iterate in small batches)
- Import errors (fictitious/broken paths)
- Name errors (undefined symbols)
- Attribute errors (missing methods/properties)
- Return type mismatches (function contracts)
- Assignment/type incompatibilities

3) Validate progress frequently
- After 15–20 errors fixed or after 2–3 edits, re-run the same MyPy task and record remaining error count.
- Keep going until zero blocking errors or you hit a genuine architectural blocker.

4) Progress cadence and stop conditions
- Cadence: run a MyPy task at least every 3–5 edits; post a compact checkpoint (PASS/FAIL + count).
- Stop only when: (a) zero blocking MyPy errors, or (b) an architectural decision is required (document the exact failing messages and file/line).

5) Guardrails (healthcare-safe)
- Never remove medical variables just to silence errors—implement or type them properly.
- Avoid `# type: ignore` in healthcare modules; prefer precise types and Optional checks.
- Maintain agent/MCP functionality—fix imports and types without disabling features.

Minimal commands are already encapsulated as VS Code tasks in this workspace. Prefer tasks over ad-hoc shell commands.

## Instruction Hierarchy Clarification (No Analysis-First)

- Specialized instruction files under `.github/instructions/**` are implementation-only
- This file (copilot-instructions.md) governs workflow. If you detect conflicting guidance elsewhere, follow the action-first rules here.
- When uncertain, choose the smallest safe change that moves the task forward and validate via the appropriate task.

## Coding Agent Environment Setup

**CRITICAL - DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**: 
- **NEVER use `npm install` or `pip install` directly**
- **ALWAYS use `make deps`** for ALL dependency management
- **NEVER suggest npm/pip commands** - user has sophisticated Makefile system
- **Process**: Add to requirements.in → run `python3 scripts/generate-requirements.py` → run `make deps`

**CRITICAL - VERSION VERIFICATION**:
- **NEVER guess package versions, API parameters, or configuration options**
- **ALWAYS verify current versions using official documentation online** (npmjs.com, PyPI, GitHub releases, official docs)
- **REQUIRED**: Use fetch_webpage tool to check official package registries before specifying versions
- **Examples**: Check npmjs.com/package/openai for OpenAI version, pypi.org for Python packages, official API docs for parameters

**First-time setup**: Run `CI=1 make deps` to install healthcare AI dependencies optimized for coding agents (excludes GPU packages). The `CI=1` environment variable automatically switches to `requirements-ci.txt` which includes all core healthcare components but excludes heavy ML packages that coding agents don't need.

**Permission Handling**: The Makefile automatically handles permission issues with smart fallbacks (system → user installation, uv → pip → apt).

**TypeScript Development**: For MCP server development in `mcps/healthcare/src/`, install TypeScript with `npm install -g typescript` or use `npx tsc` as fallback.

**Dependencies**: 
- `requirements.in` - Source dependency definitions
- `requirements.txt` - Full dependencies (including GPU packages for local development)
- `requirements-ci.txt` - Optimized for CI and coding agents (no GPU packages)

**Dependency generation**: Run `python3 scripts/generate-requirements.py` to regenerate both requirement files from `requirements.in`.

## Development Workflow & Code Quality

**Local AI Only:** Perform all AI processing on local infrastructure for PHI safety. Do not use cloud AI.

### Quick Developer Setup

Use the make targets only: `make install && make deps && make hooks && make validate`.

## Healthcare Development Essentials

- Database-first with safe fallbacks in development (never database-only in dev). Avoid PHI exposure.
- Use git hooks and lint/type checks: `make hooks`, `make lint`, `make validate`.
- Never use `# type: ignore` in healthcare modules; prefer precise types and Optional checks.
- Preserve medical variables; implement them rather than removing.

### MyPy Error Resolution Patterns

1. Add explicit types for all variables and attributes
2. Fix imports → names → attributes → return types → assignments (in that order)
3. Prefer Optional checks over suppressing errors
4. Re-run the MyPy task after small batches; checkpoint counts

## Remote Agent Execution

- Use VS Code tasks for lint/type checks and builds
- Take action first; limit context gathering to 5–10 minutes
- If you detect conflicting guidance, follow this file and proceed with minimal, safe changes
