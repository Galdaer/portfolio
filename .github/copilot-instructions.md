# Copilot Instructions for Intelluxe AI Healthcare System

make deps FOR ALL DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION DON'T SUGGEST UV , PIP, NPM, OR ANYTHING ELSE OR I WILL TURN YOU OFF

Use The Sequential Thinking MCP Server to think through your tasks.

**Use available MCP servers for RAG-powered development** - leverage Healthcare MCP, GitHub MCP, Pylance MCP, Sequential Thinking MCP, and Memory MCP to enhance development capabilities while maintaining healthcare compliance.

**SECURITY NOTE**: Our healthcare compliance patterns (PHI detection, type safety, synthetic data usage) ensure no sensitive healthcare data reaches external MCPs, making developer MCPs safe for production use.

## Coding Agent Environment Setup

**CRITICAL - DEPENDENCY MANAGEMENT**: 
- **NEVER use `npm install` or `pip install` directly**
- **ALWAYS use `make deps`** for ALL dependency management
- **NEVER suggest npm/pip commands** - user has sophisticated Makefile system
- **Process**: Add to requirements.in ‚Üí run `python3 scripts/generate-requirements.py` ‚Üí run `make deps`

**CRITICAL - VERSION VERIFICATION**:
- **NEVER guess package versions, API parameters, or configuration options**
- **ALWAYS verify current versions using official documentation online** (npmjs.com, PyPI, GitHub releases, official docs)
- **REQUIRED**: Use fetch_webpage tool to check official package registries before specifying versions
- **Examples**: Check npmjs.com/package/openai for OpenAI version, pypi.org for Python packages, official API docs for parameters
- **Pattern**: Research first ‚Üí Verify current versions/APIs ‚Üí Then implement with accurate information

**First-time setup**: Run `CI=1 make deps` to install healthcare AI dependencies optimized for coding agents (excludes GPU packages). The `CI=1` environment variable automatically switches to `requirements-ci.txt` which includes all core healthcare components but excludes heavy ML packages that coding agents don't need.

**Permission Handling**: The Makefile automatically handles permission issues with smart fallbacks (system ‚Üí user installation, uv ‚Üí pip ‚Üí apt).

**TypeScript Development**: For MCP server development in `mcps/healthcare/src/`, install TypeScript with `npm install -g typescript` or use `npx tsc` as fallback.

**Dependencies**: 
- `requirements.in` - Source dependency definitions
- `requirements.txt` - Full dependencies (including GPU packages for local development)
- `requirements-ci.txt` - Optimized for CI and coding agents (no GPU packages)

**Dependency generation**: Run `python3 scripts/generate-requirements.py` to regenerate both requirement files from `requirements.in`.

- Drug information and FDA data access (get-drug-info)
- Patient data tools (require paid FHIR API access)

**Open WebUI Integration Architecture** (Proven Working Solution):
- **Direct MCP JSON-RPC Integration**: Authentication proxy (port 3001) with direct MCP protocol communication
- **No Bridge Required**: Direct subprocess communication with Healthcare MCP server via stdio
- **All 15 Tools Available**: Genuine tool discovery through MCP tools/list protocol
- **Authentication**: Bearer token validation with healthcare-mcp-2025 API key
- **Protocol**: MCP_TRANSPORT=stdio enables proper JSON-RPC 2.0 communication

**Successful MCP Integration Pattern**:
- **Architecture**: Open WebUI ‚Üí FastAPI Auth Proxy (3001) ‚Üí Healthcare MCP Server (stdio/JSON-RPC)
- **Tool Discovery**: Real-time discovery via MCP tools/list method (not fallback mechanisms)
- **Communication**: Direct subprocess with stdin/stdout JSON-RPC messaging
- **Result**: All 15 healthcare tools properly registered and accessible

### MCP Integration Patterns

**Multi-Agent Coordination** - Use multiple MCP tools in parallel for complex clinical workflows:
```python
# Coordinate healthcare agents with MCP integration
clinical_analysis = await coordinate_clinical_workflow(
    agents=["clinical_research", "search_assistant", "medication_interaction"],
    mcp_tools=["literature_search", "sequential_thinking", "memory_search"],
    case=clinical_case,
    phi_protection=True
)
```

**Real-Time Clinical Assistance** - WebSocket integration with progressive MCP tool usage:
```python
# Real-time clinical assistance with MCP tool streaming
async for clinical_update in progressive_clinical_analysis(message, session):
    # Use MCP tools progressively for streaming clinical analysis
    await websocket.send_json(clinical_update)
```

**Evidence-Based Reasoning** - Transparent clinical logic with MCP-powered analysis:
```python
# Evidence-based reasoning using MCP tools
reasoning_result = await evidence_based_clinical_reasoning(
    clinical_question=question,
    mcp_literature_search=True,
    mcp_sequential_thinking=True,
    transparency_required=True
)
```

**‚úÖ ALLOWED - Cloud AI for Non-Sensitive Work:**

- General medical literature research and analysis
- Public health data processing (no patient identifiers)
- Development and testing with synthetic data
- General healthcare workflow optimization research
- Medical coding reference and documentation standards

**‚ùå PROHIBITED - Cloud AI for Healthcare Data:**

- Any patient health information (PHI) processing
- Real patient data analysis or decision support
- Multi-tenant architectures with healthcare data
- Cloud storage of any patient-related information
- External APIs receiving patient context or medical records

**Implementation Pattern:**

```python
# ‚úÖ Correct: Cloud AI for research, local AI for patient data
if data_contains_phi(input_data):
    result = local_ollama_model.process(input_data)  # On-premise only
else:
    result = cloud_research_api.analyze(input_data)  # OK for non-PHI research
```

This ensures we leverage the best available models for research while maintaining absolute patient privacy.

## Synthetic Healthcare Data Infrastructure

### Comprehensive Data Generation

**Located at**: `scripts/generate_synthetic_healthcare_data.py`

**Current Dataset**: 22,255+ records across 9 data types (12.9MB)

- 75 doctors, 2,500 patients, 6,000 encounters
- 5,016 lab results, 4,839 billing claims, 1,544 audit logs
- Cross-referenced and compliance-ready for local deployment

### Phase-Aligned Data Types

**Phase 1 Core Data (AI Infrastructure):**

- **Doctors** - Healthcare providers with specialties, credentials, NPI numbers
- **Patients** - Demographics, insurance, contact info (no real PHI)
- **Encounters** - Medical visits with SOAP notes, assessments, plans
- **Lab Results** - Laboratory tests with realistic values and reference ranges
- **Insurance Verifications** - Coverage validation for workflow testing
- **Agent Sessions** - AI interaction logs for Ollama/Healthcare-MCP integration

**Phase 2 Business Data (Local Automation):**

- **Billing Claims** - CPT/ICD codes, amounts, claim statuses for billing automation
- **Doctor Preferences** - Workflow settings, documentation styles for LoRA personalization
- **Audit Logs** - HIPAA compliance tracking, user actions, system events

### Data Generation Commands

```bash
# Generate comprehensive dataset (recommended for development)
python3 scripts/generate_synthetic_healthcare_data.py --doctors 75 --patients 2500 --encounters 6000

# Generate smaller test dataset
python3 scripts/generate_synthetic_healthcare_data.py --doctors 10 --patients 100 --encounters 200

# Include database population (requires running PostgreSQL/Redis)
python3 scripts/generate_synthetic_healthcare_data.py --use-database
```

### Data Reuse Strategy

- **DO NOT regenerate** unless adding new data types
- **Existing dataset supports** all Phase 1-2 testing without regeneration
- **Cross-referenced integrity** - all foreign keys properly linked
- **Future-proof design** - extensible for Phase 3 without breaking existing workflows

## Healthcare Security & Compliance

### Runtime PHI Security Model (Updated 2025-08-03)

**NEW APPROACH**: Runtime data leakage monitoring instead of static code analysis.

- **PHI lives in databases only** - never in source code
- **Tests connect to synthetic database** - no hardcoded PHI in tests  
- **Monitor runtime outputs** - logs, data pipelines, exports for PHI leakage
- **Focus on data handling** - what auditors actually check in production

**Key Files:**
- `scripts/check-runtime-phi-leakage.sh` - Runtime PHI monitoring (replaces static analysis)
- `tests/database_test_utils.py` - Database-backed test utilities
- `docs/RUNTIME_PHI_SECURITY.md` - Complete documentation of new approach

### Critical Security Rules

- **Generic Error Messages**: Never expose JWT_SECRET, MASTER_ENCRYPTION_KEY, or config details
- **Environment-Aware Placeholders**: Block production deployment when incomplete, allow configurable development
- **Comprehensive Test Coverage**: Test security fallbacks with logging verification using caplog fixture
- **Security Documentation**: Always explain WHY security choices were made (HIPAA, NANP standards, etc.)

### Medical Safety Principles

- **NO medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment recommendations**
- **Focus ONLY on administrative and documentation support**
- **Explainable AI**: All AI decisions must be traceable and auditable for healthcare compliance
- **All PHI/PII remains on-premise** - no cloud dependencies or external API calls with patient data

### Medical Module Development Patterns

- **Real Implementation Strategy**: Phase 1 requires real implementations, not mocks - replace TODOs with functional code
- **Type Error Priority**: Fix type errors systematically: imports ‚Üí unused variables ‚Üí type annotations ‚Üí method implementations
- **CRITICAL: Preserve Medical Information**: When fixing "unused" variables/methods, investigate their medical purpose and implement them properly. Never remove potentially valuable medical data to satisfy linting - implement it instead
- **Medical Disclaimers**: All medical module implementations must include healthcare compliance disclaimers in method docstrings
- **Context-First**: Always read 50+ lines of file context before making medical module edits

### Healthcare Type Safety Requirements

**‚ùå CRITICAL: Never use `# type: ignore` in healthcare code** - suppresses medical safety validation

**‚úÖ HEALTHCARE-FIRST MyPy Resolution:**
1. **Optional import patterns** with TYPE_CHECKING for missing dependencies
2. **Implement medical variables** rather than removing them (medical data is critical)  
3. **Proper type annotations** with healthcare-appropriate patterns
4. **Medical context preservation** - understand WHY variables exist before "fixing"

**Example Healthcare-Safe MyPy Fix:**
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG: Suppresses type safety for healthcare data
patient_data = get_patient_info() # type: ignore[return-value]

# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Healthcare-compliant type safety
from typing import Optional, Dict, Any

def get_patient_info() -> Optional[Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Proper return type with medical context
    pass

patient_data = get_patient_info()
if patient_data is not None:
    process_healthcare_data(patient_data)
```

## Development Workflow & Code Quality

### CRITICAL: Database-First vs Database-Only Clarification

**DATABASE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE** means:
- **Primary**: Always try database first when available
- **Fallback**: Use appropriate fallbacks for development and testing
- **Production**: Require database for PHI security, allow fallbacks for non-PHI operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with clear logging

**NOT "Database-Only"** - that would break development workflows and testing capabilities.

```python
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: Database-first pattern
def get_data(identifier):
    try:
        return database.fetch(identifier)
    except DatabaseConnectionError:
        if is_development_environment():
            return load_synthetic_data(identifier)  # OK for development
        elif is_production_environment() and contains_phi(identifier):
            raise  # PHI requires database in production
        else:
            return load_fallback_data(identifier)  # OK for non-PHI
```

### Quick Developer Setup

```bash
make install && make deps && make hooks && make validate
```

**NEVER suggest individual package installations like `npm install xyz` or `pip install xyz`**
**ALWAYS use the make system:**
- `make deps` - Installs ALL dependencies (Python, Node.js, Go tools)
- `make mcp` or `make mcp-build` - Builds Healthcare MCP server
- `make test` - Runs all tests  
- `make lint` - Runs all linting

### Git Hooks (Multi-Language Auto-Formatting)

- **Pre-commit hook**: Auto-formatting + light validation
  - **All files**: Trailing whitespace removal + safety checks
- **Pre-push hook**: `make lint && make validate` (tests skipped during development)
- **Installation**: `make hooks` installs git hooks, `make deps` installs formatting tools

### Phase-Aligned Development Approach

**Current Phase Focus** (determined by project stage):

- **Phase 1**: Core AI Infrastructure - Healthcare-MCP, multi-agent orchestration, advanced reasoning, real-time clinical assistant
- **Phase 2**: Business Services - Insurance verification, doctor personalization with LoRA training, continuous learning systems
- **Phase 3**: Production Deployment - Enterprise security, multi-tenant architecture, clinic readiness and advanced compliance

**Integration with Phase Documentation:**

- See `docs/PHASE_1.md` for core AI infrastructure priorities and modern tooling integration
- See `docs/PHASE_2.md` for business services architecture and personalization approach
- See `docs/PHASE_3.md` for production deployment and enterprise security requirements

**Modern Development Tools Overview:**

- **Ruff**: Ultra-fast Python tooling (10-100x faster than legacy black+isort+flake8)
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Multi-language auto-formatting with healthcare compliance validation
- **MyPy**: Comprehensive type checking for healthcare data safety with incremental caching (1.5s cached runs vs 3.8s fresh)
- **Advanced Security Tools**: Integrated security scanning with healthcare-specific patterns
- **Type Stubs**: Required for healthcare compliance - types-PyYAML, types-requests, types-cachetools installed

_For detailed usage patterns, configurations, and implementation guides_, reference the specialized instruction files based on your current task (see "Using Specialized AI Instructions" section above).

## Configuration Externalization Strategy

### YAML Configuration Migration

As development progresses, **consistently move hardcoded values to YAML configurations** to enable:

- **Client Customization**: Different healthcare organizations can easily configure system behavior
- **Fine-tuning Support**: Easier adjustment of AI model parameters and workflow settings
- **Deployment Flexibility**: Environment-specific configurations without code changes
- **Compliance Adaptation**: Adjustable security and audit settings for different regulatory requirements

**Implementation Pattern:**

```python
# ‚ùå Avoid: Hardcoded healthcare settings
SOAP_TEMPLATE = "Subjective: {chief_complaint}\nObjective: {vitals}"
MAX_ENCOUNTER_DURATION = 120  # minutes

# ‚úÖ Prefer: YAML-based configuration
from config.healthcare_settings import load_healthcare_config
config = load_healthcare_config()
SOAP_TEMPLATE = config.documentation.soap_template
MAX_ENCOUNTER_DURATION = config.workflows.max_encounter_duration
```

**Priority Areas for Configuration:**

- Healthcare workflow parameters and templates
- AI model settings and prompt templates
- Security and audit thresholds
- Service integration endpoints and timeouts

# Complex variables

results: Dict[str, Any] = {"status": "success"}
scenarios: List[HealthcareTestCase] = []

````

### MyPy Error Resolution Patterns

**Systematic approach to MyPy errors (438 currently identified):**

1. **Missing Type Annotations**: Add explicit types for ALL variables  
2. **Collection Issues**: Import specific types (`Set`, `List`, `Dict`) from typing
3. **Attribute Errors**: Use type annotations on class attributes
4. **Return Type Missing**: Add `-> ReturnType` to ALL function definitions
5. **Optional Handling**: Check `if obj is not None:` before method calls
6. **Type Stubs**: Ensure types-PyYAML, types-requests, types-cachetools are installed

**Performance optimizations discovered:**
- MyPy incremental caching: 1.5s (cached) vs 3.8s (fresh) - 2.5x speedup
- Use `mypy .` (full workspace) vs `mypy src/` (partial) for comprehensive healthcare safety
- Priority: Fix healthcare-critical modules first (core/medical/, src/security/), then scripts/tests

**Common MyPy Error Fixes:**

```python
# Error: Need type annotation for "data"
data = []  # ‚ùå Wrong
data: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []  # ‚úÖ Correct

# Error: "Collection[str]" has no attribute "append"
## Testing & Validation Overview

### Development Testing Standards
- **Phase 1 Implementation Testing**: Real implementations should pass functional tests
- **Healthcare Testing**: Test with realistic medical scenarios using synthetic data
- **Compliance Testing**: Validate HIPAA compliance and audit logging
- **Pre-push Validation**: Automated quality checks via git hooks

*For detailed testing strategies, healthcare test patterns, and validation workflows*, see `.github/instructions/tasks/testing.instructions.md`

## Service Architecture Overview

### Universal Service Pattern
- **Each service**: `services/user/SERVICE/SERVICE.conf`
- **Deployment**: `bootstrap.sh` calls `universal-service-runner.sh`
- **Container Security**: Development uses `justin:intelluxe (1000:1001)`
- **Network Isolation**: All containers on `intelluxe-net` with no external data egress

### Key Healthcare Services
- **Ollama** (local LLM), **Healthcare-MCP** (medical tools), **PostgreSQL** (patient context)
- **Redis** (session cache), **n8n** (workflows), **WhisperLive** (real-time transcription)

*For detailed service configuration, deployment patterns, and architecture guidance*, see appropriate specialized instruction files based on your task.

## Remote Agent Guidelines

### Autonomous Execution Requirements
- **Work continuously for 2-4 hours** without asking for continuation
- **Start with codebase analysis** (30-45 minutes) before making changes
- **Discover and fix related issues** beyond initial scope
- **Only stop for unrecoverable errors** or 100% completion

### Iterative MyPy Error Resolution Protocol
When working on MyPy errors, follow this autonomous pattern:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Run `mypy .` to get complete error count and categorize by type
2. **Capability-Based Processing**: Fix as many errors as you can handle in one session, focusing on systematic patterns
3. **Progress Validation**: After each batch, re-run `mypy .` to verify progress and get updated error count
4. **Self-Assessment**: Continue if errors remain that follow patterns you've already solved
5. **Automatic Continuation**: Create new work items if stopping before 100% completion

**CRITICAL**: Never stop MyPy error fixing just because you've done "some work" - continue iterating until either:
- All MyPy errors are resolved, OR
- Remaining errors require architectural decisions beyond systematic type annotation

**Self-Assessment Questions**:
- Are there remaining errors that follow patterns I've already solved?
- Can I add more type annotations without changing logic?
- Are there import/typing issues I can systematically resolve?
- Do I have capacity to continue with more fixes in this session?
- Do remaining errors require human architectural input?

### Self-Improving Instructions
- **Tool Issue Discovery**: When encountering environment or tool issues, update relevant instruction files to prevent future problems
- **Command Standardization**: Update commands that work in your environment for future coding agents
- **Documentation Gaps**: Add new patterns and solutions to appropriate instruction files
- **Verification Protocols**: Update verification steps when tools behave unexpectedly

### When to Use Sequential Thinking
- **Complex Implementation Decisions**: Mock vs implement, architecture choices, technical debt tradeoffs
- **Large Codebase Analysis**: Understanding module relationships and dependencies before changes
- **Multi-Step Problem Solving**: Breaking down complex fixes into manageable phases
- **Phase 1 Priority Decisions**: Deciding what real implementations are complete vs what needs finishing for MCP integration
- **MyPy Error Strategy**: Planning systematic approach for resolving remaining type errors

## Architectural Decision Principles

### CRITICAL: Always Choose Efficiency Over Simplicity
1. **Performance & Resource Efficiency FIRST**
2. **Healthcare Compliance & Security SECOND**
3. **Maintainability & Debugging THIRD**
4. **Implementation Simplicity LAST**

### CI/CD Efficiency Requirements
- **CRITICAL: Self-Hosted GitHub Actions Runner** - ALL workflow jobs MUST use `runs-on: self-hosted`
- **Strategic job dependencies** with optimal dependency graphs
- **Cache optimization strategy**: Consolidate related jobs to reduce cache restoration overhead
- **Self-hosted advantages**: No GitHub concurrency limits, better CPU resources, persistent cache potential

*For detailed CI/CD patterns, cache optimization strategies, and performance requirements*, see `.github/instructions/tasks/performance.instructions.md`
